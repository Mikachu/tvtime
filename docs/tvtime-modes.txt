  Deinterlacing modes in tvtime
  =============================

  1. Modes built for video content.
     - News shows and information channels.
     - Most live-action television dramas.
     - Sports broadcasts.
     - Most video gaming consoles.

     Television

         What does it do?
         - tvtime expands each field to full resolution,
           without ever bluring in time or copying in time.
           this effectively simulates a television.
         When do I use it?
         - You want TV-quality with low CPU, and you have
           configured your monitor to run at 59.94hz or 50hz.

         Modes available:
         - Full Resolution: High quality for fullscreen use.
         - Half Resolution: Poor quality for watching
             TV in a small window.

     Blur

         What does it do?
         - tvtime avoids flicker by blurring together
           consecutive frames of input.
         When do I use it?
         - You want to run your monitor at an arbitrary
           refresh rate, and have tvtime not use much CPU.

         Modes available:
         - Vertical: Blur vertically more than temporally,
             better for high motion content like sports.
         - Temporal: Evenly blur in time, low CPU mode for
             less flicker, but visible trails on fast motion.

     Motion adaptive

         What does it do?
         - tvtime tries to detect motion in the input
           frames, reconstructing detail where possible.
         When do I use it?
         - You want to run your monitor at an arbitrary
           refresh rate, and don't mind using a lot of CPU.

         Modes available:
         - Static detection: Pure interpolation where motion
           is detected, copy where no motion.  Moderate CPU
           requirements with high quality output.
         - Motion search: Follow motion vectors for more
           accurate interpolation.  High quality with high
           CPU requirements.

  2. Modes built for film content.
     - Films broadcast on TV or from a DVD player.
     - Cartoons and most anime.
     - Some higher budget television dramas
     - Older video gaming consoles.

     2-3 Pulldown Detection

         What does it do?
         - tvtime detects a 2-3 pulldown sequence in the
           video stream and uses this information to
           intelligently reconstruct frames.
         When do I use it?
         - Watching an NTSC broadcast of a cartoon,
           film, or television program shot on film.

         Modes available:
         - 2-3 pulldown detection can be enabled at any
           time.  This will use more CPU to analyze
           the input and detect pulldown, entering "film
           mode" when detection is successful.

     Progressive (top or bottom field first)

         What does it do?
         - tvtime constructs frames from pairs of fields.
         When do I use it?
         - Using a video game from a console system which
           sends a progressive signal.
         - Watching a film broadcast or DVD in a PAL area.

         Modes available:
         - Top Field First and Bottom Field first.  You
           must experiment with your content and see how
           it is being sent, and select the appropriate
           mode in tvtime to match it.

     2-2 Pulldown Detection

         What does it do?
         - While not currently available in tvtime, this
           option would allow us to detect progressive
           content, and whether it is top or bottom field
           first, rather than manually setting this option.
         When do I use it?
         - Using a video game from a console system which
           sends a progressive signal.
         - Watching a film broadcast or DVD in a PAL area.
