.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
tvtime is a high quality television application for use with video
capture cards.  tvtime processes the input from a capture card and
displays it on a computer monitor or projector.

  tvtime supports:

.TP
.B o
Deinterlaced output at full interlaced rate of 59.94 frames per second
for NTSC source, or 50 frames per second for PAL sources. This gives
smoothness of motion and high visual quality.

.TP
.B o
Multiple deinterlacing algorithms for finding the optimal mode for the
video content and available processor speed.

.TP
.B o
16:9 aspect ratio mode for the highest available resolution when
processing input from an external DVD player or digital satellite
receiver.

.TP
.B o
A super\-slick on\-screen\-display for the complete television
experience.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-a
This option starts tvtime in 16:9 aspect ratio mode.

.B \-h
Show usage information.

.TP
.B \-m
Start tvtime in fullscreen mode.

.TP
.B \-s
Print frame skip information (for debugging).

.TP
.B \-S
Save command line options to the config file.  This will save the V4L
device, VBI device, input number, norm, frequency, startup fullscreen
setting, aspect ratio, verbose mode, and output window height.

.TP
.B \-v
The verbose setting indicates that we should print full informational
and warning messages to stderr while running tvtime.  Otherwise, only
critical errors will be printed to the output.

.TP
.B \-F
Additional config file to load settings from.

.TP
.B \-H
Sets the height of the output window to start up at in scanlines.  The
default output window size is 576 scanlines.

.TP
.B -I
V4L input scanline sampling, defaults to 720.
This sets how many pixels per scanline to request from the capture card.
A higher setting gives better quality, while a lower setting means we do
less work, and so tvtime will run faster.  If you have a slower CPU
(like, less than 500Mhz or so), maybe values of 480 or 400 might suit
you best.  For best quality, choose a high value like 720 or 768.  Many
capture cards cannot sample higher than 768 pixels per scanline.

.TP
.B \-d
video4linux device to use (defaults to /dev/video0).

.TP
.B \-b
VBI device to use (defaults to /dev/vbi0).

.TP
.B \-i
video4linux input number (defaults to 0).  Cards commonly have a bunch
of sources, for example, for my WinTV card source 0 is my tuner and
source 1 is the composite input.

.TP
.B \-n
The mode to set the tuner to: PAL, NTSC, SECAM, PAL\-NC, PAL\-M, PAL\-N
or NTSC\-JP (defaults to NTSC).

.TP
.B \-f
The channels you are receiving with the tuner (defaults to us\-cable).

Valid values are:
        us\-cable
        us\-broadcast
        japan\-cable
        japan\-broadcast
        europe
        australia
        newzealand
        france
        russia
