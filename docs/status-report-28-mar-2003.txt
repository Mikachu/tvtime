  Hi all, here's the tvtime status report in four sections:
    1. What's going on right now
    2. What we need to finish to release 0.9.8
    3. What we will postpone until 0.9.9
    4. Outstanding long-term issues


Current goal
  - Fix remaining 0.9.7 bugs, do channel renumbering/XML files, release


1. What's going on currently
  - The DScaler loader code is active and working.
  - I rewrote the text rendering code, works great at low input sizes
    now, and I believe I have improved the speed.
  - Most of the bugs in the 0.9.7 release are fixed in CVS.
  - Achim has been busy and Alex hasn't been around, but they're still
    doing the XML stuff, right? :)  I haven't been much help here, but I
    cleaned up tvtimeconf.c, don't know if that helped or not though.
    The idea was to get code out of there so that it's easier to convert
    to loading from an XML file.
  - Doug has been too busy to do any serious hacking.

2. To do for 0.9.8
  - Channel renumbering must get solved.
  - Clean as much as possible of the list of bugs in 0.9.7.
  - Can we move to an XML config file?  We'll need a conversion script
    as well that handles converting to XML, and changing the commands to
    their new names.
  - Do a new audit of the fullscreen code after consulting with bjorn.
  - I'm going try and enable some form of 3:2 pulldown support

3. Postpone until a future release
  - While some nagging stuff got fixed, some of these are probably worth
    waiting on:
      - bug 690473 Blue frame shown on channel change when gbuffers=2
      - bug 633235 no on-frame indication of dropped frames
      - bug 628943 font aspect not updated with output
      - bug 691797 rivatv requires UYVY support
      - bug 691892 Fullscreen doesn't follow virtual desktop position
      - bug 630236 No MMX versions of MMXEXT functions

4. Outstanding long-term issues
  - We badly need to get a usable menu, and the issue is mostly just
    fighting with making sure whatever we choose is simple to extend,
    maintain, and most importantly, simple to use.  Run-time
    configuration with a menu is essential to solving many of our
    current usability problems.
  - We still need to decide how closely our deinterlacing API should try
    and follow DScaler's, and at what point it will be necessary to add
    4:2:0 support to the API.
