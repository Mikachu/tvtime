<h3><a name="configure">2. How to configure tvtime</a></h3>

<p>Almost all features of tvtime can be configured through the menu system.
Click the right mouse button, or hit tab when you run tvtime to bring up the
menu.  As well, many features can be configured through the command line
parameters.  Run '<b>tvtime --help</b>' to get a list of command line
arguments.  You can also save command line arguments to the config file
using <b>--saveoptions</b>.  For example:

<pre>
     tvtime --saveoptions --norm=pal --frequencies=europe
</pre>

<p>This will save to your config file the norm PAL and frequency table
Europe as your defaults.  See docs/default.tvtime.xml for a default
configuration file and the default runtime keybindings.</p>

<h3><a name="features">3. tvtime features</a></h3>

<h3>3.1. Deinterlacing modes</h3>

<p>tvtime includes different deinterlacing modes for different types of
content as well as different output refresh rates or CPU constraints.
Below we have separated out our modes based on their content, and
provide a description of each.</p>

<h4>3.1.1 Modes built for video content</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>News shows and information channels.
    <li>Most live-action television dramas.
    <li>Sports broadcasts.
    <li>Most video gaming consoles.
    </ul>

    <ol>

    <li><h4>Television</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><h5>What does it do?</h5>
               <p>tvtime expands each field to full resolution,
                  without ever blurring in time or copying in time.
                  this effectively simulates a television.</p>
        <li><h5>When do I use it?</h5>
               <p>You want TV-quality with low CPU, and you have
                  configured your monitor to run at the refresh
                  rate of the video signal (59.94 Hz or 50 Hz).</p>
        <li><h5>Modes available</h5>
               <ul>
               <li>Full Resolution: High quality for fullscreen use.
               <li>Half Resolution: Poor quality for watching
                   TV in a small window.
               </ul>
        </ul>

    <li><h4>Blur</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><h5>What does it do?</h5>
            <p>tvtime avoids flicker by blurring together
               consecutive frames of input.</p>
        <li><h5>When do I use it?</h5>
            <p>You want to run your monitor at an arbitrary
               refresh rate, and have tvtime not use much CPU.</p>
        <li><h5>Modes available</h5>
            <ul>
            <li>Vertical: Blur vertically more than temporally,
                better for high motion content like sports.
            <li>Temporal: Evenly blur in time, low CPU mode for
                less flicker, but visible trails on fast motion.
            </ul>
        </ul>

    <li><h4>Motion adaptive</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><h5>What does it do?</h5>
            <p>tvtime tries to detect motion in the input
               frames, reconstructing detail where possible.</p>
        <li><h5>When do I use it?</h5>
            <p>You want to run your monitor at an arbitrary
               refresh rate, and don't mind using a lot of CPU.</p>
        <li><h5>Modes available:</h5>
            <ul>
            <li>Simple and Advanced detection: Linear
                interpolation where motion is detected, copy
                where no motion.  Simple and advanced versions
                are provided to give small or moderate CPU
                requirements with high quality output.
                These are the greedy low motion and high motion
                deinterlacers from <a href="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</a>.
            <li>Motion search: Follow motion vectors for more
                accurate interpolation.  High quality with high
                CPU requirements.  This is the TomsMoComp
                deinterlacer from <a href="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</a>.
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ol>


<h4>3.1.2 Modes built for film content</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>Films broadcast on TV or from a DVD player.
    <li>Cartoons and most anime.
    <li>Some higher budget television dramas
    <li>Older video gaming consoles.
    </ul>

    <ol>
    <li><h4>Progressive (top or bottom field first)</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><h5>What does it do?</h5>
            <p>tvtime constructs frames from pairs of fields.</p>
        <li><h5>When do I use it?</h5>
            <p>Using a video game from a console system which
               sends a progressive signal.</p>
            <p>Watching a film broadcast or DVD in a PAL area.</p>
        <li><h5>Modes available:</h5>
            <ul>
            <li>Top Field First and Bottom Field first.  You
                must experiment with your content and see how
                it is being sent, and select the appropriate
                mode in tvtime to match it.
            </ul>
        </ul>

    <li><h4>Progressive Detection</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><h5>What does it do?</h5>
             <p>While not currently available in tvtime, this
                option would allow us to detect progressive
                content, and whether it is top or bottom field
                first, rather than manually setting this option.</p>
        <li><h5>When do I use it?</h5>
            <p>Using a video game from a console system which
               sends a progressive signal.</p>
            <p>Watching a film broadcast or DVD in a PAL area.</p>
        </ul>


    <li><h4>NTSC Film Mode</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><h5>What does it do?</h5>
            <p>tvtime detects a 2-3 pulldown sequence in the
               video stream and uses this information to
               intelligently reconstruct frames.</p>
        <li><h5>When do I use it?</h5>
            <p>Watching an NTSC broadcast of a cartoon,
               film, or television program shot on film.</p>
        <li><h5>How do I use it?</h5>
            <p>NTSC film detection can be enabled at any
               time.  This will use more CPU to analyze
               the input and detect pulldown, entering film
               mode when detection is successful.</p>
        </ul>
    </ol>

<p>The following is a table of the available deinterlacing modes and their
names in the config file.</p>

<h3>3.2. Using 16:9 mode</h3>

<p>In 16:9 mode we treat the incoming signal as if it were 16:9 aspect
ratio.  If you're using a hardware DVD player, you should tell it that
you have a 16:9 TV to get higher quality from your DVDs.</p>

<img src="toshiba-16x9-screenshot.jpg" alt="Setting to 16:9 on a Toshiba DVD player">

<p>The above screenshot shows the setup menu on the Toshiba SD-412V
DVD player.  Below is a screenshot of a scene from
<a href="http://imdb.com/Title?0085809">Koyaanisqatsi</a>
in 16:9 mode, giving the full vertical quality of the anamorphic
DVD content.</p>

<h3><a name="channels">5. Setting up your channel list in tvtime</a></h3>

<h3>5.1. Channel list management</h3>

<p>tvtime supports a channel scanner, channel renumbering, channel names,
and a list of active channels for browsing.  All of these features are
available within the OSD menu system itself.  Here we present some of
the details for users that wish to configure their stations
directly.</p>

<p>European users of cable providers that do not use standard frequencies
can use our channel scanner: tvtime-scanner.  This outputs to the
'Custom' frequency table, selectable in the OSD menu.</p>

<h3>5.2. stationlist.xml</h3>

<p>The station listing is read in from the ~/.tvtime/stationlist.xml.
Channel settings are saved specific to norm and frequency table.
Entries in a list are in the following form:</p>

<pre>
       &lt;station name="CNN" active="1" position="18"
                band="US Cable" channel="18"/&gt;
       &lt;station name="DSF" active="1" position="12"
                band="VHF E2-E12" channel="E12"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>The possible bands and frequencies available in tvtime are:</p>

<table border="0" width="70%" class="box">
<tr><th class="doctable">Band name
    <th class="doctable">Stations provided
<tr><td>US Cable            <td>1 - 125
<tr><td>US Two-Way          <td>T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12 T13, T14
<tr><td>US Broadcast        <td>2 - 83
<tr><td>China Broadcast     <td>1 - 68, A1 - A7, B1 - B31, C1 - C5
<tr><td>Japan Broadcast     <td>1 - 62
<tr><td>Japan Cable         <td>13 - 63
<tr><td>VHF E2-E12          <td>E1 - E12
<tr><td>VHF S1-S41          <td>S1 - S41
<tr><td>VHF Misc            <td>X, Y, Z, Z+1, Z+2
<tr><td>VHF France          <td>K01 - K10, KB - KQ, H01 - H19
<tr><td>VHF Russia          <td>R1 - R12, SR1 - SR19
<tr><td>VHF Australia       <td>AS1 - AS12, AS5A, AS9A

<tr><td>UHF Australia       <td>AU28 - AU69
<tr><td>Australia Optus     <td>01 - 058
</table>

<p>Custom frequencies can be included manually as follows:

<pre>
       &lt;station name="2" active="1" position="0"
                band="Custom" channel="55.69MHz"/&gt;
</pre>

<h4>5.3. Non-English characters in channel names</h4>

<p>
Since 0.9.8.2 it is possible to use non-English characters in channel
names. To do this, you first need to specify a character set for the XML
document. This is done by changing <tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;</tt>
to for example <tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</tt>,
depending on what encoding you want. If no encoding is specified, UTF-8
is assumed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 1:</b> If you want to display an <tt>&amp;</tt> sign, you have
to type <tt>&amp;amp;</tt> since the file is XML.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 2:</b> This non-English text support is not completely done yet.
First of all, it probably only work properly on left-to-right languages
which don't use any funky unicode features like combining characters.
Also, the glyphs have to be in <b>FreeSansBold.ttf</b>. This rules out asian
languages. Scripts that have been confirmed to work in CVS are: Latin
with accents and Cyrillic (Greek should work, but is untested).
In 0.9.8.2, only glyphs that are also in ISO-8859-1 are supported!
</p>

<h3>5.4. Future enhancements</h3>

<p>tvtime still needs a method of editing channel names at runtime
(should not be hard).</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="configfile">6. tvtime.xml config file reference</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="default.tvtime.xml">default <b>tvtime.xml</b></a> file is installed
to /etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml and documents each of the parameters.  As well, there is
a man page installed (<b>man tvtime.xml</b>) which also gives help for each of
the parameters.  We will reproduce it here soon.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="tvtimecommand">7. Controlling tvtime via tvtime-command</a></h3>

<p>With the advent of custom input devices for PCs (i.e. remotes, keyboards
with multimedia keys, voice recognition microphones) people have started to
interact with their computer using more than just a mouse and keyboard.
tvtime supports sending commands to a running tvtime process using a
utility called '<b>tvtime-command</b>', which sends them in plain text
in a fifo to the running program.  Using this, one could set the
multimedia keys on their keyboard to send commands to control changing
channels, adjusting volume, and changing deinterlace methods without
having to switch focus to tvtime (useful for those of us who like to
watch TV while browsing the web or doing some work).  Or, one could
setup their voice recognition software to control tvtime.  Do you have a
snazzy <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv/">XMLTV</a>-based
TV guide?  You could extend its functionality so that when you click on
one of the listings that is currently scheduled, tvtime changes to the
appropriate channel so you can watch the show.</p>

<p>To send commands to tvtime, simply execute the <b>tvtime-command</b>
program, along with any number of commands as its arguments.  The
following is a list of commands known to tvtime:</p>

<table border="0" width="70%" class="box">
<tr><th class="doctable">Command
    <th class="doctable">Description
<tr><td><b>AUTO_ADJUST_PICT</b>
    <td>Restores the picture settings (brightness, contrast, hue, colour) to
        their default values.

<tr><td><b>AUTO_ADJUST_WINDOW</b>
    <td>Automatically resize the window to match the content inside it.  This
        is for when you resize tvtime into, say, a long rectangle, and want it
        to jump back to being a perfect 4:3 box around the content.

<tr><td><b>BRIGHTNESS_DOWN</b>
    <td>Lowers the brightness setting on the input.

<tr><td><b>BRIGHTNESS_UP</b>
    <td>Increases the brightness setting on the input.

<tr><td><b>CHANNEL_[0-9]</b>
    <td>Simulates a keypad number press.

<tr><td><b>CHANNEL_ACTIVATE_ALL</b>
    <td>Re-activates all channels in the list.  Use this to re-initialize the
        channel list before running the scanner if you believe some channels
        are missing, or if new channels have become available.

        useful for using tvtime with mirroring projectors, although I don't
        think it will actually work as intended yet since we don't mirror
        the OSD output.  :)  Comments appreciated.

<tr><td><b>TOGGLE_PAUSE</b>
    <td>Enters tvtime's pause mode.  Pause mode is a debugging feature used to
        test deinterlacer filters by allowing to see the output of a single set
        of frames with various deinterlacers.

<tr><td><b>TOGGLE_PULLDOWN_DETECTION</b>
    <td>Toggles between the available 2-3 pulldown detection modes.  Modes

<h3><a name="lirc">8. Configuring LIRC for tvtime</a></h3>

<p>If you have lirc (Linux Infrared Remote Control) installed on your system 
you can control tvtime with your remote control. Everything you can do 
with the keyboard should be possible to do with your remote control.</p>

<p>For .lircrc you need to know that the program name to use is
<b>irexec</b> and it should be told to run <b>tvtime-command</b> with
the appropriate tvtime command to execute.  The commands are those listed
in the <a href="#tvtimecommand">previous section</a>.</p>

<p>So, to be able to turn off tvtime with your remote you have to edit your 
~/.lircrc to include the following:</p>

<pre>
begin
  prog = irexec
  button = the_one_you_want_on_your_remote
  config = tvtime-command quit
end
</pre>

<hr>
<h3><a name="lircpower">9. Case study: Configuring the power button as both tvtime start and exit using LIRC</a></h3>

<p>Some users like the ability to turn on tvtime both on and off using their
remote controls.  This can be configured using lirc by adding the following
to your <b>~/.lircrc</b> file:</p>

<pre>
begin
  prog = irexec
  button = POWER
  config = tvtime &amp;
  config = tvtime-command QUIT
end
</pre>

<p>This works such that when pressed once, tvtime starts, and on the second
press, tvtime will exit.</p>

<h3><a name="savetuning">10. Case study: How to save fine tuning settings on a channel</a></h3>

<p><b>Problem:</b> <i>Channel 13 has poor reception, but if I fine tune it up by
three notches, the picture is much clearer.  How do I save this setting?</i></p>

<p>Saving fine tuning settings is done automatically in tvtime.  When
you fine tune a station, the fine tuning is remembered as the default in
that menu.  The current fine tune setting can be discovered through the
menu system.</p>

<h3><a name="progressivedv">11. Case study: Progressive content from a DV camera</a></h3>

<p><b>Problem:</b> <i>I have a Canon GL-1 DV camera with a
progressive-scan mode (called frame movie mode).  How do I get the best
quality with this in tvtime?</i></p>

<p>First, set your deinterlacer to <b>Progressive: Top Field First</b>
using the '<b>t</b>' key (<b>TOGGLE_DEINTERLACER</b>).  In this mode,
tvtime copies the last two fields it received together as a frame.  If
the video does not look correct, try <b>Progressive: Bottom Field
First</b>.  In the correct mode, you will see the progressive frames as
captured by the DV camera.</p>
