<h3><a name="features">2. tvtime features</a></h3>

<h3>2.1. Deinterlacing modes</h3>

<p>The following deinterlacing modes are currently available in <b>tvtime</b>:</p>

<table border="0" width="70%" class="box">

<h3>2.2. Using 16:9 mode</h3>

<p>In 16:9 mode we treat the incoming signal as if it were 16:9 aspect
ratio.  If you're using a hardware DVD player, you should tell it that
you have a 16:9 TV to get higher quality from your DVDs.</p>

<img src="toshiba-16x9-screenshot.jpg" alt="Setting to 16:9 on a Toshiba DVD player">

<p>The above screenshot shows the setup menu on the Toshiba SD-412V
DVD player.  Below is a screenshot of a scene from
<a href="http://imdb.com/Title?0085809">Koyaanisqatsi</a>
in 16:9 mode, giving the full vertical quality of the anamorphic
DVD content.</p>

<img src="wsshot-small.jpg" alt="An anamorphic DVD viewed in tvtime">

<h3>2.3. What is luma correction?</h3>

<p>The luma correction applies a non-linear correction function to the luma
signal of the incoming video.  This allows the user to attempt to increase
the brightness of the signal in a way which preserves the low as well as the
high end of the brightness scale.  This feature also allows to correct
for odd values from capture cards, such as those based on the popular
<b>bt8x8</b> chip.</p>

<h3><a name="channels">4. Setting up your channel list in tvtime</a></h3>

<h3>4.1. Channel list management</h3>

<p>tvtime supports a channel scanner, channel renumbering, channel names,
and a list of active channels for browsing.  Below are the commands
available for input bindings and through tvtime-command, along with
their default key bindings.</p>

<table border="0" width="70%" class="box">
<tr><th class="doctable">Command
    <th class="doctable">Description

<tr><td><b>CHANNEL_SAVE_TUNING (F9)</b>
    <td>Saves the current fine tuning settings as a custom channel in the
        station list.

<tr><td><b>CHANNEL_SCAN (F10)</b>
    <td>Walks from the current position through the channel list,
        disabling any channels for which no signal is detected.  This
        command is only available if signal checking is enabled.

<tr><td><b>CHANNEL_ACTIVATE_ALL (F11)</b>
    <td>Re-activates all channels in the list.  Use this to re-initialize
        the channel list before running the scanner if you believe some
        channels are missing, or if new channels have become available.

<tr><td><b>CHANNEL_SKIP (F12)</b>
    <td>Toggles the current channel as being active or disabled in the
        station list.  You can use this to manually scan your channels and
        enable those with signal or disable duplicate stations.

<tr><td><b>CHANNEL_RENUMBER (r)</b>
    <td>Renumbers the current channel.  This will swap the current channel
        with the number you type in.  Use this to configure your station
        list to suit preference or locality.
</table>


<h3>4.2. stationlist.xml</h3>

<p>The station listing is read in from the ~/.tvtime/stationlist.xml.
Channel settings are saved specific to norm and frequency table.
Entries in a list are in the following form:</p>

<pre>
       &lt;station name="CNN" active="1" position="18"
                band="US Cable" channel="18"/&gt;
       &lt;station name="DSF" active="1" position="12"
                band="VHF E2-E12" channel="E12"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>The possible bands and frequencies available in tvtime are:</p>

<table border="0" width="70%" class="box">
<tr><th class="doctable">Band name
    <th class="doctable">Stations provided
<tr><td>US Cable            <td>1 - 125
<tr><td>US Two-Way          <td>T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12 T13, T14
<tr><td>US Broadcast        <td>2 - 83
<tr><td>Japan Broadcast     <td>1 - 62
<tr><td>Japan Cable         <td>13 - 63
<tr><td>VHF E2-E12          <td>E1 - E12
<tr><td>VHF S1-S41          <td>S1 - S41
<tr><td>VHF Misc            <td>X, Y, Z, Z+1, Z+2
<tr><td>VHF France          <td>K01 - K10, KB - KQ, H01 - H19
<tr><td>VHF Russia          <td>R1 - R12, SR1 - SR19
<tr><td>VHF Australia       <td>AS1 - AS12, AS5A, AS9A
<tr><td>VHF Italy           <td>A - H, H1, H2
<tr><td>VHF Ireland         <td>I1 - I9
<tr><td>UHF                 <td>U21 - U69
<tr><td>Australia Optus     <td>01 - 058
</table>

<p>Custom frequencies can be included manually as follows:

<pre>
       &lt;station name="2" active="1" position="0"
                band="Custom" channel="55.69MHz"/&gt;
</pre>

<h4>4.3. Non-English characters in channel names</h4>

<p>
Since 0.9.8.2 it is possible to use non-English characters in channel
names. To do this, you first need to specify a character set for the XML
document. This is done by changing <tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;</tt>
to for example <tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</tt>,
depending on what encoding you want. If no encoding is specified, UTF-8
is assumed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 1:</b> If you want to display an <tt>&amp;</tt> sign, you have
to type <tt>&amp;amp;</tt> since the file is XML.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 2:</b> This non-English text support is not completely done yet.
First of all, it probably only work properly on left-to-right languages
which don't use any funky unicode features like combining characters.
Also, the glyphs have to be in <b>FreeSansBold.ttf</b>. This rules out asian
languages. Scripts that have been confirmed to work in CVS are: Latin
with accents and Cyrillic (Greek should work, but is untested).
In 0.9.8.2, only glyphs that are also in ISO-8859-1 are supported!
</p>

<h3>4.4. Future enhancements</h3>

<p>tvtime still needs a method of editing channel names at runtime
(should not be hard), a full frequency band scanner, native support for
the weird frequencies used by some cable providers such as UPC.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="configfile">5. tvtime.xml config file reference</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="default.tvtime.xml">default <b>tvtime.xml</b></a> file is installed
to /etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml and documents each of the parameters.  As well, there is
a man page installed (<b>man tvtime.xml</b>) which also gives help for each of
the parameters.  We will reproduce it here soon.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="tvtimecommand">6. Controlling tvtime via tvtime-command</a></h3>

<p>With the advent of custom input devices for PCs (i.e. remotes, keyboards
with multimedia keys, voice recognition microphones) people have started to
interact with their computer using more than just a mouse and keyboard.
tvtime supports sending commands to a running tvtime process using a
utility called '<b>tvtime-command</b>', which sends them in plain text
in a fifo to the running program.  Using this, one could set the
multimedia keys on their keyboard to send commands to control changing
channels, adjusting volume, and changing deinterlace methods without
having to switch focus to tvtime (useful for those of us who like to
watch TV while browsing the web or doing some work).  Or, one could
setup their voice recognition software to control tvtime.  Do you have a
snazzy <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv/">XMLTV</a>-based
TV guide?  You could extend its functionality so that when you click on
one of the listings that is currently scheduled, tvtime changes to the
appropriate channel so you can watch the show.</p>

<p>To send commands to tvtime, simply execute the <b>tvtime-command</b>
program, along with any number of commands as its arguments.  The
following is a list of commands known to tvtime:</p>

<h3><a name="lirc">7. Configuring LIRC for tvtime</a></h3>

<p>If you have lirc (Linux Infrared Remote Control) installed on your system 
you can control tvtime with your remote control. Everything you can do 
with the keyboard should be possible to do with your remote control.</p>

<p>For .lircrc you need to know that the program name to use is tvtime and 
the configuration lines that you can use are the commands listed in the 
<a href="#tvtimecommand">previous section</a>.</p>

<p>So, to be able to turn off tvtime with your remote you have to edit your 
~/.lircrc to include the following:</p>

<pre>
begin
  prog = tvtime
  button = the_one_you_want_on_your_remote
  config = quit

<p><b>Problem:</b> <i>Channel 13 has poor reception, but if I fine tune it up by
three notches, the picture is much clearer.  How do I save this setting?</i></p>

<p>Saving fine tuning settings is performed in three stages.  First,
tune tvtime such that the picture is clearest.  Then, hit '<b>F9</b>'
(<b>CHANNEL_SAVE_TUNING</b>).  This creates a custom frequency entry in
your station list, and the display will read its new number.  We then
have to map this new channel back to <b>13</b>.  To do this, hit
'<b>r</b>' (<b>CHANNEL_RENUMBER</b>), type in '<b>13</b>', and hit enter.
This will renumber the new tuned channel as if it were <b>13</b>.</p>

<h3><a name="progressivedv">9. Case study: Progressive content from a DV camera</a></h3>

<p><b>Problem:</b> <i>I have a Canon GL-1 DV camera with a
progressive-scan mode (called frame movie mode).  How do I get the best
quality with this in tvtime?</i></p>

<p>First, set your deinterlacer to <b>Weave</b> using the '<b>t</b>' key
(<b>TOGGLE_DEINTERLACER</b>).  In <b>Weave</b> mode, tvtime copies the
last two fields it received together as a frame.  Next, set the
framerate using '<b>=</b>' (<b>TOGGLE_FRAMERATE</b>) to either half-rate
<b>TFF</b> or <b>BFF</b>, whichever removes the combing artifacts.  In
this mode, you will see the progressive frames as captured by the DV
camera.</p>
