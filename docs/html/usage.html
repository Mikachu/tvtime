        <h3><a name="configure">1. Setting up tvtime</a></h3>

        <p>Almost all features of tvtime can be configured through the menu system.
        Click the right mouse button, or hit tab when you run tvtime to bring up the
        menu.  As well, many features can be configured through the command line
        parameters.  Run '<b>tvtime --help</b>' to get a list of command line
        arguments.  You can also save command line arguments to the config file
        using <b>--saveoptions</b>.  For example:

<pre>
     tvtime --saveoptions --norm=pal --frequencies=europe
</pre>

        <p>This will save to your config file the norm PAL and frequency table
        Europe as your defaults.  See docs/default.tvtime.xml for a default
        configuration file and the default runtime keybindings.</p>

        <h3><a name="deinterlacing">2. Deinterlacing modes explained</a></h3>

        <p>tvtime includes different deinterlacing modes for different types of
        content as well as different output refresh rates or CPU constraints.
        Below we have separated out our modes based on their content, and
        provide a description of each.</p>

        <h4>Modes for video content</h4>

        <p>Most of the deinterlacing methods in tvtime are intended for use on
        video content.  All of the following are considered video content:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>News shows and information channels.
            <li>Most live-action television dramas.
            <li>Sports broadcasts.
            <li>Most video gaming consoles.
            </ul>

        <p>We provide three classes of video deinterlacers: <b>Television</b>,
        <b>Blur</b> and <b>Motion adaptive</b>.</p>

        <h4>Television mode, full and half resolution</h4>

        <p>In television mode, tvtime expands each field to full resolution,
        without ever blurring in time or copying in time.  this effectively
        simulates a television.  Use this mode when you want TV-quality with low
        CPU, and you have configured your monitor to run at the refresh rate of
        the video signal (59.94 Hz or 50 Hz).  There are two television
        deinterlacers:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Full Resolution: High quality for fullscreen use.
        <li>Half Resolution: Poor quality for watching
            TV in a small window.
        </ul>

        <h4>Blur mode, temporal and vertical</h4>

        <p>In blur mode, tvtime avoids flicker by blurring together consecutive
        frames of input.   Use this if you want to run your monitor at an
        arbitrary refresh rate, and have tvtime not use much CPU.  There are two
        blur modes available:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Vertical: Blur vertically more than temporally,
            better for high motion content like sports.
        <li>Temporal: Evenly blur in time, low CPU mode for
            less flicker, but visible trails on fast motion.
        </ul>

        <h4>Motion adaptive modes, search, advanced and simple detection</h4>

        <p>The motion adaptive modes in tvtime try to detect motion in the input
        frames, reconstructing detail where possible.  You want to run your
        monitor at an arbitrary refresh rate, and don't mind using a lot of
        CPU.  There are three modes available in tvtime:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Simple and Advanced detection: Linear interpolation where motion is
            detected, copy where no motion.  Simple and advanced versions are
            provided to give small or moderate CPU requirements with high quality
            output.  These are the greedy low motion and high motion deinterlacers
            from <a href="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</a>.
        <li>Motion search: Follow motion vectors for more accurate
            interpolation.  High quality with high CPU requirements.  This is
            the TomsMoComp deinterlacer from <a href="http://dscaler.org/">DScaler</a>.
        </ul>


        <h4>Modes built for film content</h4>

        <p>We are still working on better support for film detection
        modes in tvtime, but we already support some useful
        features.  Film content is what we would call anything that
        either originated from film or has been converted to video from
        an originally progressive format.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Films broadcast on TV or from a DVD player.
            <li>Cartoons and most anime.
            <li>Some higher budget television dramas
            <li>Older video gaming consoles.
            </ul>

        <h4>Progressive (top or bottom field first)</h4>

        <p>In progressive mode, tvtime constructs frames from pairs of fields.
        Use this mode if you are using a video game from a console system which
        sends a progressive signal, or are watching a film broadcast or
        DVD in a PAL area.  There are two modes available:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Top Field First and Bottom Field first.  You
            must experiment with your content and see how
            it is being sent, and select the appropriate
            mode in tvtime to match it.
        </ul>

        <h4>Progressive Detection</h4>

        <p>While not currently available in tvtime, this option would allow
        us to detect progressive content, and whether it is top or bottom field
        first, rather than manually setting this option.  This would be
        able to autodetect content that would be helped by using the
        above progressive modes.</p>

        <h4>NTSC Film Mode</h4>

        <p>tvtime can detect a 2-3 pulldown sequence in the video stream and
        use this information to intelligently reconstruct frames.
        Enable this when watching an NTSC broadcast of a cartoon, film, or
        television program shot on film.  The feature can be found in the
        in the input filters menu in tvtime.</p>


        <p>The following is a table of the available deinterlacing modes and their
        names in the config file.</p>

<h3><a name="sixteennine">3. Using widescreen 16:9 mode</a></h3>

<p>In 16:9 mode we treat the incoming signal as if it were 16:9 aspect
ratio.  If you're using a hardware DVD player, you should tell it that
you have a 16:9 TV to get higher quality from your DVDs.</p>

<h3><a name="channels">5. Setting up your channel list in tvtime</a></h3>

<p>tvtime supports a channel scanner, channel renumbering, channel names,
and a list of active channels for browsing.  All of these features are
available within the OSD menu system itself.  Here we present some of
the details for users that wish to configure their stations
directly.</p>

<p>European users of cable providers that do not use standard frequencies
can use our channel scanner: tvtime-scanner.  This outputs to the
'Custom' frequency table, selectable in the OSD menu.</p>

<h3>stationlist.xml</h3>

<p>The station listing is read in from the ~/.tvtime/stationlist.xml.
Channel settings are saved specific to norm and frequency table.
Entries in a list are in the following form:</p>

<pre>
       &lt;station name="CNN" active="1" position="18"
                band="US Cable" channel="18"/&gt;
       &lt;station name="DSF" active="1" position="12"
                band="VHF E2-E12" channel="E12"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>The possible bands and frequencies available in tvtime are:</p>

<h3>Non-English characters in channel names</h3>

<p>Since 0.9.8.2 it is possible to use non-English characters in channel
names. To do this, you first need to specify a character set for the XML
document. This is done by changing <tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;</tt>
to for example <tt>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</tt>,
depending on what encoding you want. If no encoding is specified, UTF-8
is assumed.</p>

<p><b>Note 1:</b> If you want to display an <tt>&amp;</tt> sign, you have
to type <tt>&amp;amp;</tt> since the file is XML.</p>

<p><b>Note 2:</b> This non-English text support is not completely done yet.
First of all, it probably only work properly on left-to-right languages
which don't use any funky unicode features like combining characters.
Also, the glyphs have to be in <b>FreeSansBold.ttf</b>. This rules out asian
languages.</p>

<h3><a name="configfile">6. The tvtime.xml config file</a></h3>

<p>tvtime's config file is written as an XML document.
A <a href="default.tvtime.xml">default <b>tvtime.xml</b></a> file is installed
to <tt>/etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml</tt> and documents each of the parameters.  As well, there is
a man page installed (<tt>man tvtime.xml</tt>) which also gives help for each of
the parameters.  An alternate config file may be specified on the command
line using the <tt>--configfile</tt> option.  Additional config files are loaded
after reading defaults from <tt>/etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml</tt> and
<tt>$HOME/.tvtime/tvtime.xml</tt>.</p>

<h3><a name="tvtimecommand">7. Controlling tvtime via tvtime-command</a></h3>

<p>Modern PCs now have many custom input devices, such as remotes, multimedia
keys, and voice recognition microphones.  tvtime helps support alternate
inputs through an application called <b>tvtime-command</b>.  This application
can send commands to control changing channels, adjusting volume, or navigating
the menu without having to switch focus to tvtime.  This allows for many
extended features.</p>

<p>To send commands to tvtime, simply execute the <b>tvtime-command</b>
program, along with any number of commands as its arguments.  The
following is a list of commands known to tvtime:</p>

<table width="90%" class="doclist">

<tr><th class="docboxleft">AUTO_ADJUST_WINDOW
<tr><td class="docentry"><p>
Automatically resize the window to match the content inside it.  This
