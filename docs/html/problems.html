        <h2>Capture card problems</h2>

        <h3><a name="tvwonder">1. Channels black-and-white and numbers
            off-by-one</a></h3>

        <p>The tuner driver defaults to detecting a PAL tuner on many NTSC
        capture cards, a notable example being the ATI TV Wonder cards.  This
        causes all of the cable frequencies to be out of alignment, channel
        numbers are off-by-one and slightly detuned.  To fix this, the tuner
        module must be told explicitly the tuner type when it is loaded by doing
        the following:</p>

<pre>
    modprobe tuner type=2
</pre>

        <p>You may have to first remove the bttv module if it is already
        loaded.  To make this change automatic, in your
        <tt>/etc/modules.conf</tt> file, add the following line:</p>

<pre>
    options tuner type=2
</pre>

        <p>This will ensure that whenever the tuner module is loaded, it will
        use the correct tuner for this card.  If this does not fix the problem
        please post a bug report on
        <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=64301&amp;atid=506987">the
        tvtime bugs page</a>.</p>

        <p>To attack this problem, we believe that the tuner module must be
        fixed to correctly detect the difference in tuner, as so many users
        are affected by this problem.  To help with this, please follow up on
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=711428&amp;group_id=64301&amp;atid=506987">tvtime bug 711428</a>.</p>


        <h3><a name="bttvbuffers">2. Too few buffers with bttv before kernel
            2.4.21</a></h3>

        <p>The popular <a href="http://bytesex.org/bttv/">bttv</a> capture
        driver only provided applications with two buffers by default in
        versions shipped with kernels before 2.4.21.  Our advanced
        deinterlacing algorithms require a longer history of past input
        frames in order to predict motion in the video stream.</p>

        <p>To give applications more buffers, use this option when
        loading the bttv driver:</p>

<pre>
    modprobe bttv gbuffers=4
</pre>

        <p>To make this change automatic, add the following in your
        <tt>/etc/modules.conf</tt> file:</p>

<pre>
    options bttv gbuffers=4
</pre>

        <h3><a name="bttvload">3. bttv takes a long time to load</a></h3>

        <p>On some cards without a tuner, bttv can take a long time to load
        (a few minutes).  If you see this problem, try using this option
        in your modules.conf file for loading the <tt>i2c-algo-bit</tt>
        module:</p>

<pre>
    options i2c-algo-bit bit_test=1
</pre>

        <p>If that does not help, please post a bug report.</p>

        <h3><a name="prolink-audio">4. Audio problems with Prolink PixelView
            cards</a></h3>

        <p>The bttv driver seems to misdetect Prolink Pixelview cards pretty
        badly.  There are five Prolink cards listed in CARDLIST for the bttv
        driver:</p>

<pre>
  card=16 - Prolink Pixelview PlayTV (bt878)
  card=37 - Prolink PixelView PlayTV pro
  card=50 - Prolink PV-BT878P+4E /
            PixelView PlayTV PAK /
            Lenco MXTV-9578 CP
  card=70 - Prolink Pixelview PV-BT878P+ (Rev.4C)
  card=72 - Prolink Pixelview PV-BT878P+9B
            (PlayTV Pro rev.9B FM+NICAM)
</pre>

        <p>The bttv driver cannot seem to autodetect these cards correctly.
        We have found that cards which should use <tt>card=70</tt> but are
        instead loaded using <tt>card=72</tt> are causing audio mute/unmute
        to fail randomly, or even be inverted, resulting in no audio or just
        snippets of audio.  To avoid this, please make sure you are using the
        correct variant of this card.  Specifically, the <b>rev 9D</b> of
        the newer Pixelview cards should use <tt>card=70</tt> and not
        <tt>card=72</tt>.</p>

        <h3><a name="linux-dvb">5. Green and corrupted frames with the

        <h3><a name="zoran">6. Problems with the zoran driver (used by the
            DC10 cards)</a></h3>

        <p>Once someone tried to use tvtime with the
        <a href="http://www.cicese.mx/~mirsev/Linux/DC10plus/">zoran driver
        for the DC10plus and related cards</a> that is part of a
        <a href="http://mjpegtools.sourceforge.net">larger project called
        'mjpegtools'</a>.  This is an older card, and depending on your PCI
        configuration, many users with seemingly high powered machines
        experience extremely poor performance.  Please read
        <a href="zoran-email.txt">this email extract from the driver
        authors</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="marvel">7. Problems with Matrox Marvel capture
            cards</a></h3>

        <p>A user has reported an unsuccessful attempt to use tvtime with
        a G400 marvel card supported by
        <a href="http://marvel.sourceforge.net">Matrox Marvel driver
        project</a>.  To quote:</p>

        <p><i>"Its taking 38ms to grab a frame, but the marvel does all
        its own scaling in hardware (ie not via Xv, well I dont think
        it does) the anoying thing is that if the hardware scaling is
        in use Xv cant be used."</i></p>

        <p><i>"It would be nice if tvtime supported overlay mode so that
        us marvel users can at least use the 16:9 mode in fullscreen."</i></p>

        <p>I think we may be able to get this card working, but it will take
        someone with a bit of know-how to figure out what the card expects,
        and I guess the ability to shut off whatever hardware scaling prevents
        us from using XVideo.</p>

        <h3><a name="rivatv">8. Poor performance with the rivatv capture
             driver</a></h3>

        <p>By default, the rivatv the driver copies frames from video memory
        into system memory, which can harm performance.  Performance can be
        improved by using <b>DMA</b> to transfer the frames, however, this
        option only works when using the open-source <b>"nv"</b> driver in X,
        not with the NVIDIA binary drivers.</p>

        <p>You can turn on dma support as follows in your <b>modules.conf</b>
        file:</p>

<pre>
    options rivatv dma=1

        <h3><a name="aiw">9. Unusable drivers for ATI All-In-Wonder
            video+capture cards</a></h3>

        <p>ATI has a line of video cards with video capture capabilities,
        and the <a href="http://gatos.sourceforge.net/">GATOS</a> project
        develops drivers for these cards which includes <b>km</b>, a kernel
        module for a Video4Linux interface to the capture components on
        these cards.</p>

        <p><i>This is <b>just</b> for video cards with capture capabilities,
        not for the <b>ATI TV Wonder</b> line of capture cards which use the
        BT878 chip and are supported by the bttv driver.</i></p>

        <p>The Video4Linux interface provided by
        <a href="http://gatos.sourceforge.net/">GATOS</a> is currently
        unusable with tvtime, and at this point it seems unlikely that
        they ever will.  The problems are:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>The rumor is that the All-In-Wonder cards cannot both capture and
            allow an application to use the hardware overlay scaler of the
            card.  If this is true, then tvtime would be unable to do any
            processing on the video.
        <li>The Video4Linux interface provided by the km driver is nonstandard.
            It provides at field rate instead of frame rate, and does not
            seem to provide a way of detecting this.  This may require
            additional code to support it in tvtime.
        <li>The km driver only supports <b>read()</b> mode, which is currently
            untested in the tvtime code.  If someone could test this out, I
            would appreciate it.
        </ol>

        <p>Assistance in investigating this for conclusive information would be
        appreciated.  Please contact the tvtime developers if you can help
        out.</p>

        open-source driver, since it can use the kernel module component to
        negotiate DMA transfers for video frames.  Where possible, stick to
        the binary drivers when using tvtime on NVIDIA hardware.</p>

        <h3><a name="nvidia-tnt">8. Problems with NVIDIA TNT and TNT2
            cards</a></h3>

        <h4>Corrupted frames</h4>

        <p>The TNT and TNT2 cards are very limited in their bandwidth, and this
        problem will appear as horizontal lines in the video output unless
        the monitor is at a low resolution.  Smaller output window sizes
        will make the problem worse, as the DAC will have to read out more data
        in the same amount of time.  This problem should not occur with any of
        the GeForce series cards.</p>

        <h4>Card cannot downscale</h4>

        <p>A user of a <b>NV5: RIVA TNT2 Ultra (rev 11)</b> noted that the card
        cannot downscale video, it only crops it.  This is apparently a
        hardware deficiency of many TNT cards, and the XVIDEO API provides
        no way to detect this case.</p>

        <h4>Poor performance at high resolution and refresh rate</h4>

        <p>A user of a <b>TNT2 Vanta</b> card reported that blit performance
        was absolutely terrible until they went down to a resolution of
        800x600, at which point speed quadrupled.  We believe this is due
        to bandwidth problems on these cards.</p>

        <h3><a name="savage">9. XVideo initialization problem with the
            savage driver</a></h3>

        <p>We've investigated a bug where the <b>savage</b> X driver does not
        initialize its XVideo subsystem unless it starts on a modeline where
        the resolution equals the virtual resolution.  That is, if you have
        a virtual resolution of 1600x1200, make sure you start on a
        1600x1200 mode, otherwise XVideo won't initialize.</p>

        <p>This bug was <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/devel%40xfree86.org/msg01248.html">noted on the XFree86 devel list</a>.</p>



        <h2>Driver conflicts</h2>

        <h3><a name="overlay">1. Using overlay mode in xawtv or zapping
            causes system instabilities</a></h3>

        <p>Overlay mode, as can be used in xawtv or zapping, causes system
        instabilities.  This is because their 'overlay' mode allows the capture
        card to write directly to video memory without locking it first, which
        is unsafe for many video cards, specifically those which do not use a
        linear framebuffer (such as NVIDIA cards with the binary drivers).</p>

        <p>Use of the xawtv/overlay mode has caused system crashes, and
        specifically, can cause tvtime to crash if it tries to use XVideo
        features after the framebuffer area has been destroyed by the capture
        card (see
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=702539&amp;group_id=64301&amp;atid=506987">tvtime bug 702539</a>).</p>

        <p>A workaround for having a no-CPU-access mode is to use the XFree86
        "v4l" extension, which allows safe use of the framebuffer by capture
        cards.  tvtime does not support using this mode, nor do we plan to,
        as we would not be able to composite our OSD on top of the video
        signal or perform any processing of the video.</p>

        <h3><a name="apm">2. apm driver known to cause frame drops</a></h3>

        <p>We had a problem report that in RH9 (later 2.4 kernel), the
        GNOME battery applet was polling apm every few seconds.  This caused
        the system to block for 50-100ms causing stutters in video
        playback.</p>

        <h3><a name="ntfs">3. ntfs driver known to cause frame drops</a></h3>

        <p>We had a problem report that having gkrellm running would cause
        frame drops in tvtime.  We believe this was due to the ntfs driver,
        as the frame drops occurred whenever gkrellm was monitoring the
        users' other disk that had ntfs partitions.  See
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=634674&amp;group_id=64301&amp;atid=506987">tvtime bug 634674</a>.</p>
