It depends on the Zoran PCI controller (new versions work better than
the old one), and on the motherboard. Intel is much better than VIA,
for example...

It's not so simple. I can only guess which hardware combination will
work and which will not (see above). And the hardware provides no
means to detect any buffer overflow for uncompressed video capture.
Perhaps, this is because the card was primarily designed for MJPEG
capture (low bandwidth) and to provide video monitoring on the
computer display (no RAM access,  just the PCI-PCI transfer from Zoran
to any graphics adapter. It can capture uncompressed video into memory
even at full frame rate but not on every system. My old system with
Pentium MMX 266MHz with Intel 430TX works better than newer Athlon XP
1800+ at VIA KT266A and DDR memory. Pentium MMX system can capture
uncompressed video to memory but can do nothing with it due to CPU and
disk I/O limitations. Athlon system can do anything (even encode into
MPEG-4 in real time) but some uncompressed frames are dropped due to
PCI limitations on VIA chipset...

This is a limit from Linux kernel: it will not give you contiguous
memory  longer than 128Kbytes without some special tricks: bigphysmem
patch or reserving memory at system boot using mem=XXX line in LILO or
GRUB configs.

Bigphysmem patch or reserving memory at boot time.  I suggest you to
read  README file: it has notes about this.

If you need help, please, describe your system: motherboard chipset,
processor, memory size and type, etc. Also please note that older
ZR36057 chip may not work properly on some motherboards.  Newer
ZR36067 is better but it also may have problems with VIA chipsets.
