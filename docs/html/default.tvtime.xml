  <!--
    Default $HOME/.tvtime/tvtime.xml configuration file.
    Do not edit this config file while tvtime is running, it
    will be overwritten during runtime to update program settings.
  -->


  <!--
    The verbose setting indicates that we should print full
    informational and warning messages to stderr while running tvtime.
    Otherwise, only fatal errors will be printed to the output.
  -->
  <option name="Verbose" value="0"/>


  <!-- This sets the default capture device to use. -->
  <option name="V4LDevice" value="/dev/video0"/>

  <!--
    This sets the default capture card input to be opened by tvtime.
    For example, for my WinTV card has the tuner as source 0, and
    its composite input as source 1.  Sources can be changed at runtime
    using the "toggle_input" command, which is key command "i" by
    default.
  -->
  <option name="V4LInput" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This sets the default TV norm.  Valid options are:
       NTSC
       NTSC-JP
       SECAM
       PAL
       PAL-Nc
       PAL-M
       PAL-N
       PAL-60
  -->
  <option name="Norm" value="NTSC"/>

  <!--
    This sets the default frequency table to use for any tuners found.
    Possibilities are:
       us-cable
       us-broadcast
       japan-cable
       japan-broadcast
       europe
       australia
       australia-optus
       newzealand
       france
       russia
  -->
  <option name="Frequencies" value="US-Cable"/>

  <!--
    There are two special NTSC cable standards in the US: IRC and HRC.
    In IRC, channels 5 and 6 are on different frequencies, and HRC mode
    shifts all frequencies up by 1.25MHz (and is also weird on channels
    5 and 6).  Use this option to set the cable mode to "Standard",
    "IRC", or "HRC".  It is very rare that you will see cable systems
    that use IRC or HRC cable.
  -->
  <option name="NTSCCableMode" value="Standard"/>

  <!--
    Toggle whether tvtime should check if there is a signal present
    when changing channels etc.  If your card doesn't suck, you
    shouldn't need to shut this off.  Disabling this feature will also
    disable the channel scanner.
  -->
  <option name="CheckForSignal" value="1"/>

  <!--
    This sets how many pixels per scanline to request from the capture
    card.  A higher setting gives better quality, while a lower setting
    means we do less work, and so tvtime will run faster.  If you have
    a slower CPU (like, less than 500Mhz or so), maybe values of 480
    or 400 might suit you best.  For best quality, choose a high value
    like 720 or 768.  Most capture cards cannot sample higher than 768
    pixels per scanline.
  -->
  <option name="InputWidth" value="720"/>

  <!--
    Set this to a filename to get show listings from an xmltv file.
    Set to "none" if you do not wish to use xmltv.
  -->
  <option name="XMLTVFile" value="none"/>

  <!--
    Set this to a two-letter language code to set the language to use
    for entries in the XMLTV file (for example, use "de" for German).
    Set to "none" if you wish to use the default language of the file.
  -->
  <option name="XMLTVLanguage" value="none"/>

  <!--
    Set this to 1 to enable XDS channel information decoding.  This
    option is specific to NTSC regions.  XDS is used to send information
    about the channel including the network name and call letters, and
    sometimes information about the current show.  This information is
    then shown on the OSD and saved to the stationlist.xml file.
  -->
  <option name="UseXDS" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This sets which device to use for VBI decoding.
  -->
  <option name="VBIDevice" value="/dev/vbi0"/>

  <!--
    This sets the mixer device and channel to use.  The format is device
    name:channel name.  Valid channels are:
      vol, bass, treble, synth, pcm, speaker, line, mic, cd, mix, pcm2,
      rec, igain, ogain, line1, line2, line3, dig1, dig2, dig3, phin,
      phout, video, radio, monitor
   -->
  <option name="MixerDevice" value="/dev/mixer:line"/>

  <!--
    This option enables 16:9 aspect ratio mode by default on startup.
  -->
  <option name="Widescreen" value="0"/>

  <!--
    Disabling this option tells tvtime to use the X server DPI to determine
    pixel shape.  By default, tvtime assumes pixels are square.  Set this
    to 0 if you have a 4:3 monitor but run it at 1280x1024 and want tvtime
    to do the right thing.
  -->
  <option name="SquarePixels" value="1"/>

  <!--
    Sets the geometry of the window.  A width value of 0 signifies
    that the appropriate width for the given height will be used.
    For 4:3 content on a square pixel display, this defaults to a
    768x576 window.
  -->
  <option name="WindowGeometry" value="0x576"/>

  <!--
    This sets the percent of the sides to leave to the overscan, that
    is, don't show them at all.  Safe action area on a television is 10%
    in the overscan, but that's a bit restrictive.  If you want tvtime
    to look like a TV, a good value would be about 6-8%.  The value is
    in percent, so for 8%, use 8.0.
  -->
  <option name="Overscan" value="3.5"/>

  <!--
    Set this to 1 to have tvtime start in fullscreen mode.  This setting is
    set at runtime so that when you quit tvtime in fullscreen, starting it
    again will start back in fullscreen mode.
  -->
  <option name="Fullscreen" value="0"/>

  <!--
    Sets the position of the output when in fullscreen mode: top, bottom
    or centre.  When set to top, tvtime in fullscreen will place its output
    at the top of the screen.  Use this if you have a projector to help
    tvtime fit properly onto your screen.
  -->
  <option name="FullscreenPosition" value="Centre"/>

  <!--
    Set this to 1 to have tvtime start in always-on-top mode under
    supporting window managers.  This setting is set at runtime so
    that when you quit tvtime in always-on-top mode, starting it again
    will start back in always-on-top mode.
  -->
  <option name="AlwaysOnTop" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This sets the framerate of the output from tvtime.

    0 = Full framerate mode, every field is deinterlaced.
        59.94fps for NTSC, 50fps for PAL.
    1 = Half framerate mode, deinterlace every top field to a frame (TFF).
        29.97fps for NTSC, 25fps for PAL.
    2 = Half framerate mode, deinterlace every bottom field to a frame (BFF).
        29.97fps for NTSC, 25fps for PAL.

    The two half framerate modes are useful for progressive content from
    video game consoles.  Use weave and select either TFF or BFF, whichever
    does not exhibit interlace effects.
  -->
  <option name="FramerateMode" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This option indicates whether tvtime should enable its own saving and
    restoring of picture settings, both on startup and per channel change.
  -->
  <option name="SaveAndRestorePictureSettings" value="1"/>

  <!--
    If Save/Restore is turned on, this is where we store the global
    default settings.  Each value is from 0-100.  If the value is -1, then
    we don't set that setting on startup.
  -->
  <option name="DefaultBrightness" value="-1"/>
  <option name="DefaultContrast" value="-1"/>
  <option name="DefaultColour" value="-1"/>
  <option name="DefaultHue" value="-1"/>

  <!--
    This option saves the last used audio mode.  This will be used to
    remember which audio mode to select when the application is next
    started.  Valid options here are "mono", "stereo", "lang1", "lang2"
    or "sap".
  -->
  <option name="AudioMode" value="stereo"/>

  <!--
    This option sets the audio boost.  This is a percentage for how
    much to set the volume coming out of the capture card.  By default,
    tvtime does not set the audio at all.  However, because the volume
    sometimes does not have a sane default, or is reset by other
    applications, you can use this value to have it always set to your
    favorite volume.  Use -1 to have tvtime not touch the volume.
  -->
  <option name="AudioBoost" value="-1"/>

  <!--
    This option saves the state of closed caption decoding.  Closed
    captions are an NTSC-specific text version of the audio for the
    hearing impaired.
  -->
  <option name="ShowCC" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This value saves the on-off state of the colour invert filter across
    sessions.
  -->
  <option name="ColourInvert" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This value saves the on-off state of the mirror filter across sessions.
  -->
  <option name="MirrorInput" value="0"/>

  <!--
    When this option is turned on, screenshots will not announce
    themselves on the OSD.  This is useful if you intend to take a
    lot of screenshots, and don't want the text to interrupt your TV
    watching or appear in other screenshots.
  -->
  <option name="QuietScreenshots" value="0"/>


  <!--
    Sets the default process priority.  By default, tvtime tries to
    set itself at a priority of -10 which is higher than normal
    applications.  Acceptable values are from -20 to 20, with lower
    values meaning higher priority.
  -->
  <option name="ProcessPriority" value="-10"/>

  <!--
    Sets the time format to be used in the tvtime on-screen display.
    The format is a string in the same format as strftime(3).  The
    default is to use the time format of your locale.
  -->
  <option name="TimeFormat" value="%X"/>

  <!--
    This is the default directory in which screenshots are placed.
    The default is to save them into the user's home directory.
  -->
  <option name="ScreenShotDir" value="~"/>

  <!--
    These options set the ARGB colours used for the text in the
    on-screen display.  The default for the channel name is "yellow"
    (0xffffff00), and the default for the surrounding text is "wheat"
    (0xfff5deb3).  The colour format can be hexadecimal or decimal.
    If the alpha channel is not specified the default is "opaque" (255).

    Examples: 0xffaadd, 0xff0000ff, 0xff, 0xffff, 255 255 0, 0, 
              16777215.
  -->
  <option name="ChannelTextFG" value="0xFFFFFF00"/>
  <option name="OtherTextFG" value="0xFFF5DEB3"/>

  <!--
    This setting saves the volume before muting across tvtime
    sessions.  You should not ever need to set this yourself.
  -->
  <option name="UnmuteVolume" value="-1"/>

  <!--
    This setting saves whether or not tvtime was muted when it was
    last exited.  You should not ever need to set this yourself.
  -->
  <option name="Muted" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This setting controls whether tvtime should mute its mixer device on
    exit.  This can be used to work around noisy capture cards.
  -->
  <option name="MuteOnExit" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This setting controls whether tvtime should show the silly taglines
    in the window title bar.  Set to 0 to shut them off.
  -->
  <option name="ShowTaglines" value="1"/>

  <!--
    This setting is saved at runtime to remember the current channel.
  -->
  <option name="PrevChannel" value="2"/>

  <!--
    This setting is saved at runtime to remember the previous channel.
  -->
  <option name="Channel" value="2"/>

  <!--
    This setting is saved at runtime the deinterlacer used.

    Supported deinterlacers are:

    TelevisionFull    Television: Full Resolution
    TelevisionHalf    Television: Half Resolution
    BlurVertical      Blur: Vertical
