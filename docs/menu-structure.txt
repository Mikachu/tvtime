The tvtime menu should be small, simple,
and sufficient.

With the menu we can select a set of standard key bindings which are
considered core.  For example, picture settings are not required for the
core, as it's something one would usually expect to be in a menu and not
its own keys on a remote.  As well, all station management functions
should be in the menu, and not using up keys.  Our core keys are:

  esc  Quit
  i    Change input
  p    Previous channel
  0-9  Channel change input
  ent  Enter
  up   Channel up
  down Channel down
  m    Mute
  +    Volume up
  -    Volume down
  f    Fullscreen
