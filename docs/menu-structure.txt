The tvtime menu should be small, simple,
and sufficient.

With the menu we can select a set of standard key bindings which are
considered core.  For example, picture settings are not required for the
core, as it's something one would usually expect to be in a menu and not
its own keys on a remote.  As well, all station management functions
should be in the menu, and not using up keys.

Our core keys are:

  esc   Quit
  i     Change input
  m     Mute
  +     Volume up
  -     Volume down
  f     Fullscreen
  s     Screenshot
  d     Show stats
  bs    Previous channel

No need to mention these, they should be obvious:

  up    Channel up
  down  Channel down
  ent   Enter
  0-9   Channel change input

Commands that are in the menu (which should lose keystrokes?):

  t     Deinterlacer
  y     Deinterlacer description
  p     Pulldown detection
  v     Always-on-top
  r     Renumber
  F10   Scan
  F11   Activate all
  F12   Skip
  w     Toggle CC
  =     Toggle framerate
  ' '   Reset picture settings
  a     Aspect ratio
  F1/F2 Brightness
  F3/F4 Contrast
  F5/F6 colour
  F7/F8 Hue
  c     Luma correction
  e     Audio mode
  <     Overscan down
  >     Overscan up
  n     PAL/SECAM
  o     NTSC Cable Mode

Commands you can only do via keystrokes:

  /     Adjust window
  ins   Matte mode
  b     Colour bars
  *     Mode
  F9    Save tuning
  END   Pause
  `     Console
  pgup  Scroll console up
  pgdn  Scroll console down
  ,     Mixer mute
  z x   Luma up/down

These we need to decide on:

  left  Finetune down
  right Finetune up
  u     Show menu
