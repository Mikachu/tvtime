With the menu we can select a set of standard key bindings which are
considered core.  For example, picture settings are not required for the
core, as it's something one would usually expect to be in a menu and not
its own keys on a remote.  As well, all station management functions
should be in the menu, and not using up keys.

Our core keys are:

  esc/q     Quit
  F1/tab/B3 Show menu
  up/B4     Channel up
  down/B5   Channel down
  bs        Previous channel
  i         Change input
  m/B2      Mute
  -         Volume down
  +         Volume up
  f         Fullscreen
  s         Screenshot
  ?/B1      Display info
  d         Display debug statistics
  enter     Enter
  0-9       Channel change input

Our keys in menu mode:

  esc/q/F1/tab/B3  Exit menu
  down/B5          Menu down
  up/B4            Menu up
  left             Menu left
  right            Menu right
  enter/B1         Menu enter

Commands in the menu that also deserve keystrokes:

  left  Finetune down
  right Finetune up
  <     Overscan down
  >     Overscan up
  e     Audio mode
  a     Aspect ratio
  r     Renumber
  v     Always-on-top
  p     Pulldown detection
  t     Deinterlacer
  =     Toggle framerate
  F5    Picture
  F6    Picture up
  F7    Picture down
  c     Toggle CC
  ins   Matte mode

Commands just for the menu:

        Contrast down
        Contrast up

        Skip
