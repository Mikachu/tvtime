If you have lirc (Linux Infrared Remote Control) installed on your system 
you can control tvtime with your remote control. Everything you can do 
with the keyboard should be possible to do with your remote control.

For .lircrc you need to know that the program name to use is tvtime and 
the configuration lines that you can use are the same as for the keyboard 
configuration but without key_ in the beginning. Valid keyboard strings 
can be found on http://tvtime.sourceforge.net.

So, to be able to turn off tvtime with your remote you have to edit your 
~/.lircrc to include the following:

begin
  prog = tvtime
  button = the_one_you_want_on_your_remote
  config = quit
end
