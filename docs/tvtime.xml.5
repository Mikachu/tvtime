.SH NAME
tvtime.xml -- tvtime configuration file

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B ~/.tvtime/tvtime.xml

.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
The tvtime.xml file is the main configuration file for tvtime.  It
contains all of the default settings, key bindings, and preset mode
definitions.  The tvtime.xml file is updated by tvtime at runtime, to
store settings across sessions.  For this reason, you should not edit
the tvtime.xml file while tvtime is running, as your changes may be
overwritten.

The global syntax is as follows:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE tvtime PUBLIC "-//tvtime//DTD tvtime 1.0//EN"
      "http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/DTD/tvtime1.dtd">
    <tvtime xmlns="http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/DTD/">
    </tvtime>

You can find the DTD and other information at the namespace URL.

.SH OPTIONS

The following is a list of options and their default values, along with
a description of what the option does.

  <!--
    The verbose setting indicates that we should print full informational
    and warning messages to stderr while running tvtime.  Otherwise, only
    fatal errors will be printed to the output.
  -->
  <option name="Verbose" value="0"/>


  <!-- This sets the default capture device to use. -->
  <option name="V4LDevice" value="/dev/video0"/>

  <!--
    This sets the default capture card input to be opened by tvtime.
    For example, for my WinTV card has the tuner as source 0, and
    its composite input as source 1.  Sources can be changed at runtime
    using the 'toggle_input' command, defaulting to a key command of 'i'.
  -->
  <option name="V4LInput" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This sets the default TV norm.  Valid options are "ntsc", "pal",
    "secam", "pal-nc", "pal-m", "pal-n", and "ntsc-jp".
  -->
  <option name="Norm" value="NTSC"/>

  <!--
    This sets the default frequency table to use for any tuners found.
    Possibilities are:
       us-cable
       us-broadcast
       japan-cable
       japan-broadcast
       europe
       australia
       australia-optus
       newzealand
       france
       russia
  -->
  <option name="Frequencies" value="US-Cable"/>

  <!--
    There are two special NTSC cable standards in the US: IRC and HRC.
    In IRC, channels 5 and 6 are on different frequencies, and HRC mode
    shifts all frequencies up by 1.25MHz (and is also weird on channels
    5 and 6).
  -->
  <option name="NTSCCableMode" value="Nominal"/>

  <!--
    Toggle whether tvtime should check if there is a signal present when
    changing channels etc.  If your card doesn't suck, you shouldn't need
    to shut this off.  Disabling this feature will also disable the
    channel scanner.
  -->
  <option name="CheckForSignal" value="1"/>

  <!--
    This sets how many pixels per scanline to request from the capture card.
    A higher setting gives better quality, while a lower setting means we do
    less work, and so tvtime will run faster.  If you have a slower CPU (like,
    less than 500Mhz or so), maybe values of 480 or 400 might suit you best.
    For best quality, choose a high value like 720 or 768.  Most capture
    cards cannot sample higher than 768 pixels per scanline.
  -->
  <option name="InputWidth" value="720"/>


  <!--
    Set this to 1 to enable VBI decoding.  tvtime supports decoding of closed
    captions and XDS channel information data.  Both of these standards are
    specific to NTSC regions, since that's what the tvtime authors use. :)
  -->
  <option name="UseVBI" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This sets which device to use for VBI decoding.
  -->
  <option name="VBIDevice" value="/dev/vbi0"/>


  <!-- This option enables 16:9 aspect ratio mode by default on startup. -->
  <option name="Widescreen" value="0"/>

  <!-- Default to a 768x576 window. -->
  <option name="OutputHeight" value="576"/>

  <!--
    This sets the percent of the sides to leave to the overscan, that is,
    don't show them at all.  Safe action area on a television is 10% in
    the overscan, but that's a bit restrictive.  If you want to look like
    a TV, a good value would be about 6-8%.  The value is in percent,
    so for 8% use 8.0.
  -->
  <option name="Overscan" value="0.0"/>

  <!--
    Set this to 1 to have tvtime start in fullscreen mode.  This setting is
    set at runtime so that when you quit tvtime in fullscreen, starting it
    again will start back in fullscreen mode.
  -->
  <option name="Fullscreen" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This sets the framerate of the output from tvtime.

    0 = Full framerate mode, every field is deinterlaced.
        59.94fps for NTSC, 50fps for PAL.
    1 = Half framerate mode, deinterlace every top field to a frame (TFF).
        29.97fps for NTSC, 25fps for PAL.
    2 = Half framerate mode, deinterlace every bottom field to a frame (BFF).
        29.97fps for NTSC, 25fps for PAL.

    The two half framerate modes are useful for progressive content from
    video game consoles.  Use weave and select either TFF or BFF, whichever
    does not exhibit interlace effects.
  -->
  <option name="FramerateMode" value="0"/>


  <!--
    This indicates whether the luma correction option should be enabled by
    default when starting the application.  Luma correction can be turned
    on or off within the application using the 'c' key.
  -->
  <option name="ApplyLumaCorrection" value="0"/>

  <!--
    This indicates the power for correction.  A value of 1.0 does nothing
    except apply Bt8x8 correction, if you have a Bt8x8-based capture card.
    Values less than one make the output darker, and values greater than
    one make the output brighter.  The valid range is 0.1 to 10.0 in
    increments of 0.1.
  -->
  <option name="LumaCorrection" value="1.0"/>


  <!--
    Sets the default process priority.  By default, tvtime tries to be
    a real hog and get -19 priority, which is insane, but hey, if a
    frame comes in we need to process it right away or it gets dropped,
    right? :)    Acceptable values are from -20 to 20, with lower values
    meaning higher priority (blame UNIX for that).
  -->
  <option name="ProcessPriority" value="-19"/>

  <!--
    Sets the time format to be used in the tvtime OSD.  The format is a
    string in the same format as strftime().  See 'man strftime' for
    details on the format used.  The default is to use the time format
    of your locale.
  -->
  <option name="TimeFormat" value="%X"/>

  <!--
    This is the default directory in which screenshots are placed.
    The default is into user's home directory.
  -->
  <option name="ScreenShotDir" value="~"/>

  <!--
    These options set the ARGB colours used for the text in the OSD.
    The default for the channel name is yellow, and the default for
    the surrounding text is "wheat".  The colour format can be hex
    or decimal.  If the alpha channel is not specified the default
    is 255 (opaque).

    Examples: 0xffaadd, 0xff0000ff, 0xff, 0xffff, 255 255 0, 0, 16777215
  -->
  <option name="ChannelTextFG" value="0xFFFFFF00"/>
  <option name="OtherTextFG" value="0xFFF5DEB3"/>

  <!--
    The following settings are saved at runtime to remember your current
    channel, previous channel, and deinterlacer used.
  -->
  <option name="PrevChannel" value="2"/>
  <option name="Channel" value="2"/>
  <option name="DeinterlaceMethod" value="GreedyH"/>


  <!--
    Preset 'modes' for tvtime may be defined for convenience.  By
    default, tvtime ships with two useful modes: LargeWindow and
    SmallWindow.

    <option name="DeinterlaceMethod" value="GreedyH"/>
  </mode>

  <mode name="SmallWindow">
    <option name="DeinterlaceMethod" value="OverlayBob"/>
    <option name="FramerateMode" value="1"/>
    <option name="OutputHeight" value="288"/>

.SH BINDINGS
Key presses and mouse button presses can be mapped to tvtime commands.
For a description of commands known to tvtime, see
.B tvtime-command (1).

Multiple keys and mouse buttons may be bound to the same command.  For
convenience, tvtime supplies aliases for special keys.  The special keys
known to tvtime are:

.B Up, Down, Left, Right, Insert, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, F1, F2, F3,
.B F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, F13, F14, F15, Backspace, Escape,
.B Enter, Print, Menu

An example key binding would be for the command
.B CHANNEL_UP.
In this case, we have two keys bound to the command as well as a mouse
button.

  <bind command="channel_up">
    <keyboard key="up"/>
    <keyboard key="k"/>
    <mouse button="4"/>
  </bind>
