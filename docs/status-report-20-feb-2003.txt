  Hi all, here's the tvtime status report in four sections:
    1. What's going on right now
    2. What we need to finish to release 0.9.7
    3. What we will postpone until a soon release
    4. Outstanding long-term issues


Current goal
  - A month ago I said we should release 0.9.7 for the bugfixes ASAP.
    This has gone on too long now, I think we should just release what
    we have by Monday.
  - Simon is around enough that if I do a release, a debian package
    should follow quickly after.  Let's forget about his issues for now
    and if necessary do a 0.9.8.1 for debian.


1. What's going on currently
  - Both Alex and Achim are hot on getting libxml2 code in there. 
  - The whole frequency code got rewritten by Achim, and we now have
    config file saving too.
  - I did a bunch of bugfixing with the V4L code to support the SAA7134
    better, and provide more intelligent error messages.
  - I was playing with a new deinterlacer filter, but I'm going to
    disable it for the release since it isn't yet worth using.
  - Doug has still been too busy to do any hacking.
  - I disabled the VBI code in CVS for the release.

2. To do for 0.9.7
  - Make sure the new FAQ page is very detailed about problems relating
    to incorrect tuner (bug 646494).
  - Make sure EWMH support is enabled (bug 646494).
  - Write documentation on the low cpu deinterlacing methods (no bug).
  - Edit the gentoo ebuild to install all documentation (bug 683494).
  - Ensure we're sync'ed with the ogle fullscreen code (no bug).

3. Postpone until the future
  - We're going to wait on autoscan (bug 633024).
  - We're still going to have to wait on some of the smaller UI issues
    and missing options:
      - bug 633235 on 'no on-frame indication of dropped frames'
      - bug 635005 on 'no way to specify deinterlacing algorithm'
      - bug 664637 on 'tvtime should install its own default config'
      - bug 650218 on 'no way to disable deinterlacing algorithms'
      - bug 650218 on 'no support for 16:9 geometry'
      - bug 628943 on 'font aspect not updated with output'
      - bug 690428 on 'No detection of non-square-pixel displays'
  - I'm not going to finish 3:2 pulldown support for the next release
    (bug 633606).
  - I'm not going to enable the DScaler dll loader, there are some
    annoying issues to solve (no bug).
  - We need to make sure our gentoo ebuild is more explicit with the
    required compiler options to avoid problems (no bug).

4. Outstanding long-term issues
  - We badly need to get a usable menu, and the issue is mostly just
    fighting with making sure whatever we choose is simple to extend,
    maintain, and most importantly, simple to use.  Run-time
    configuration with a menu is essential to solving many of our
    current problems with frequency tables, auto-detection, and
    usability.
  - We still need to decide how closely our deinterlacing API should try
    and follow DScaler's, and at what point it will be necessary to add
    4:2:0 support to the API.
