 This is the second draft of a survey i think we should run.
 Please comment on it (or answer it!) and send to vektor@dumbterm.net
 for now.  We should decide on what questions we should ask and run
 this when we release 0.9.7.

                tvtime user survey for 0.9.7

Introduction
============

This survey represents some questions for our users which we believe can
help us better understand what features we should focus on, and also how
we can better tune the finer details of the application towards how it
will be used.

Please answer as many questions as you like, and email them to
tvtime-survey@dumbterm.net.  Your help is greatly appreciated.

 Thanks,
 -The tvtime development team
