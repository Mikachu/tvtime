-----------------

This document describes some of the basic design of tvtime: the code
structure and organization, the coding style, philosophies, etc.


Program structure
-----------------


Initialization

1. Startup and load configuration
2. Steal performance as much as possible
3. Open video input
4. Start the main loop


/**
 * Explination of the loop:
 *
 * We want to build frames so that they look like this:
 *  Top field:      Bot field:
 *     Copy            Blank
 *     Interp          Copy
 *     Copy            Interp
 *     Interp          Copy
 *     Copy            --
 *     --              --
 *     --              Interp
 *     Blank           Copy
 *
 *  So, say a frame is n high.
 *  For the bottom field, the first scanline is blank (special case).
 *  For the top field, the final scanline is blank (special case).
 *  For the rest of the scanlines, we alternate between Copy then Interpolate.
 *
 *  To do the loop, I go 'Interp then Copy', and handle the first copy
 *  outside the loop for both top and bottom.
 *  The top field therefore handles n-2 scanlines in the loop.
 *  The bot field handles n-2 scanlines in the loop.
 *
 * What we pass to the deinterlacing routines:
 *
 * Each deinterlacing routine can require data from up to four fields.
 * The current field is being output is Field 4:
 *
 * | Field 1 | Field 2 | Field 3 | Field 4 |
 * |         |   T0    |         |   T1    |
 * |   M0    |         |    M1   |         |
 * |         |   B0    |         |   B1    |
 *
 * So, since we currently get frames not individual fields from V4L, there
 * are two possibilities for where these come from:
 *
 * CASE 1: Deinterlacing the top field:
 * | Field 0 | Field 1 | Field 2 | Field 3 | Field 4 |
 * |   T-1   |         |   T0    |         |   T1    |
 * |         |   M0    |         |    M1   |         |
 * |   B-1   |         |   B0    |         |   B1    |
 *  [--  secondlast --] [--  lastframe  --] [--  curframe   --]
 *
 * CASE 2: Deinterlacing the bottom field:
 * | Field 0 | Field 1 | Field 2 | Field 3 | Field 4 |
 * |   T-1   |         |   T0    |         |   T1    |
 * |         |   M0    |         |    M1   |         |
 * |   B-1   |         |   B0    |         |   B1    |
 * ndlast --] [--  lastframe  --] [--  curframe   --]
 *
 * So, in case 1, we need the previous 2 frames as well as the current
 * frame, and in case 2, we only need the previous frame, since the
 * current frame contains both Field 3 and Field 4.

Tuner state

  Happy State  - Tuner signal is high, input unheld

1)              Happy
                  |
     Fine       ChChange     Lose Signal
                  |
          Save last input frame
        Interpolate to field height
2)   Hold that frame as input, last and secondlast

                |
3)  a) Signal detected
        - Wait for 2 input frames, then show input

   b) No signal for four frames, begin fade to colour bars


HAS_SIGNAL
SIGNAL_DETECTED
SIGNAL_LOST
NO_SIGNAL

if signal
  switch state
      case NO_SIGNAL
      case LOST_SIGNAL
          state = SIGNAL_DETECTED
          aquire_wait = AQUIRE_DELAY
          recover_wait = 0

      case SIGNAL_DETECTED
          if aquire_wait
              aquire_wait--
          else
             state = HAVE_SIGNAL

else no signal
  switch state
      case HAVE_SIGNAL
          save last frame
      case SIGNAL_DETECTED
          state = LOST_SIGNAL
          recover_wait = RECOVER_DELAY

      case LOST_SIGNAL
          if recover_wait
              recover_wait--
          else
              state = NO_SIGNAL
              osd says no signal
  fade bars


if state = HAVE_SIGNAL
  show_frame
else
  show (current bars/save fade)


/** Handling changes to frame size
    (not overscan, norm changes though, and half-size mode?)

   Need to update:
  1. output layer
  2. menu ?  yeah.
  3. osd definitely

*/


Rendering
  Foreach scanline
    Filter input scanline to temporary memory
