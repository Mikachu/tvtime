through a FIFO, otherwise known as a named pipe.  Commands are 
case\-insensitive, and are executed in order.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B AUTO_ADJUST_PICT
Restores the picture settings (brightness, contrast, hue, colour) to
their default values.

.TP
.B AUTO_ADJUST_WINDOW
Automatically resize the window to match the content inside it.  This
is for when you resize tvtime into, say, a long rectangle, and want it
to jump back to being a perfect 4:3 box around the content.

.TP
.B BRIGHTNESS_DOWN
Lowers the brightness setting on the input.

.TP
.B BRIGHTNESS_UP
Increases the brightness setting on the input.

.TP
.B CHANNEL_[0\-9]
Simulates a keypad number press.

.TP
.B CHANNEL_ACTIVATE_ALL
Re-activates all channels in the list.  Use this to re-initialize the
channel list before running the scanner if you believe some channels are
missing, or if new channels have become available.

.TP
.B CHANNEL_DEC / CHANNEL_DOWN
Move one channel down in the channel list.

.TP
.B CHANNEL_PREV
Changes to the last channel you were at.  Useful for jumping back and
forth between two programs on distant channels.

preference or locality.

.TP
.B CHANNEL_SAVE_TUNING
Saves the current fine tuning settings as a custom channel in the
station list.

.TP
.B CHANNEL_SCAN
Walks from the current position through the channel list, disabling any
channels for which no signal is detected.  This command is only
available if signal checking is enabled.

.TP
.B CHANNEL_SKIP
Toggles the current channel as being active or disabled in the station
list.  You can use this to manually scan your channels and enable those
with signal or disable duplicate stations.

.TP
.B CHANNEL_INC / CHANNEL_UP
Move one channel up in the channel list.

Sends a virtual enter command.  Use this when changing the channel:
.br
\h'4n'tvtime-command channel_1 channel_5 enter
.br
will change to channel 15.

.TP
.B MIXER_DOWN
Decreases the volume setting for the Line In device from 
.IR /dev/mixer .

.TP
.B MIXER_TOGGLE_MUTE
Toggles the mute status with the mixer, and not with the capture card
like
.B TOGGLE_MUTE
does.

.TP
.B MIXER_UP
Increases the volume setting for the Line In device from 
.IR /dev/mixer .

.TP
.B OVERSCAN_DOWN
Decreases the overscan compensation amount.  This will show more of the
captured input.

.TP
.B OVERSCAN_UP
Increases the overscan compensation amount.  This will show less of the

.B SCREENSHOT
Asks
.B tvtime
to take a screenshot.  Screenshots are saved to the directory listed as
the screenshot directory in the
.I tvtime.xml
configuration file.  The default is the
running user's home directory.

.TP
.B SCROLL_CONSOLE_DOWN
Scrolls down in the console's history buffer.

.TP
.B SCROLL_CONSOLE_UP
Scrolls up in the console's history buffer.

.TP
.B SHOW_STATS
Asks
.B tvtime
to output debugging statistics to standard error.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_ASPECT
Toggles the display between 4:3 and 16:9 mode.  Use 16:9 mode if you
have configured an external DVD player or satellite receiver to output
anamorphic 16:9 content.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_AUDIO_MODE
Toggles between the available audio modes on this channel.  It can take
some time before the driver discovers that modes are available.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_BARS
Asks
.B tvtime
to display colourbars.  The colourbars are generated by
.B tvtime
and are not related to the capture card, but simply to help
configure your video card and display device.  Once your settings are
correct with these colourbars, try colourbars from an input source like
an external DVD player and make sure they match up.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_CC
Enables closed caption information to be displayed in the
.B tvtime
window.
Closed captioning is only available if you have enabled VBI reading in
your
.I tvtime.xml
configuration file.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_COMPATIBLE_NORM
Toggles between norms which are compatible with the selected norm in
terms of framerate and frame size.  If the input selected has a tuner,
the setting is saved as the default norm for that channel only.  This
feature is useful for regions which receive both PAL and SECAM channels,
such that tvtime can be configured on a per-channel basis for the
correct norm.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_CONSOLE
Shows or hides the
.B tvtime
console window.  Using the
.B tvtime
console, you can type in any of the commands in this document and have
them executed.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_FULLSCREEN
This toggles between fullscreen and windowed mode.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_FRAMERATE
Toggles the framerate at which
.B tvtime
will output.  Options are full frame
rate (every field deinterlaced to a frame), half frame rate TFF (every
top field deinterlaced to a frame) and half frame rate BFF (every bottom
field deinterlaced to a frame).

.TP
.B TOGGLE_INPUT
Switches the capture card input used.  Among the Inputs are: the
tuner, composite, or S-Video connectors on the capture card.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_LETTERBOX
Switches between the available letterbox modes.  This cuts off the top
and bottom of the input picture to help fit the window to the image
content.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_LUMA_CORRECTION
This command enables or disables the luma correction feature.
When enabled, this will try to correct for the incorrect colour space
provided by bt848 and bt878 based capture cards.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_MODE
Loads the next saved mode settings.  The default configuration file
defines two modes: a small window mode with a low quality deinterlacer
setting used, and a high quality large window mode, suitable for use at
fullscreen.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_MUTE
Toggles the mute state in the capture card (and not in
your soundcard).

.TP

Toggles the NTSC cable mode settings: 
.IR Standard ,
.IR IRC ", and "
.I HRC

test deinterlacer filters by allowing to see the output of a single set
of frames with various deinterlacers.

.TP
.B TOGGLE_PULLDOWN_DETECTION
Toggles between the available 2\[en]3 pulldown detection modes.  Modes
