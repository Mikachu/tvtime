  Hi all, here's the tvtime status report in four sections:
    1. What's going on right now
    2. What we need to finish to release 0.9.7
    3. What we will postpone until a soon release
    4. Outstanding issues


Current goal
  - We should release 0.9.7 for the bugfixes asap, even if none of the
    feature work we've been doing is enabled.


1. What's going on currently
  - bitstream did alot of work on closed caption decoding and XDS
    decoding for north american TV
  - Joachim Koenig did some code which will allow us to load and use
    DScaler dll files directly.  I did some work on putting that code
    into tvtime, but more work is necessary before we can include that.
  - I'm also working on solving the frequency mess.  There is still no
    solution I'm really happy with.
  - There has been alot of problems with the saa7134 driver, and I'm
    not sure what I can do to help solve them.
  - bitstream is really busy with work and is pretty much out for a
    while, and I've been pretty busy with the start of this school term.
  - I added some low-cpu deinterlacing methods (half framerate mode, and
    half-size-with-xvideo bobbing).

2. To do for 0.9.7
  - Make sure the PAL-M bug fix is in (bug 646494).
  - Even if we do another release with 'ugly' frequency support, make
    sure all of the channels are in for Australia (bug 646494),
    europe-west (bug 646494), and Italy (unconfirmed complaint on IRC).
  - Make sure all our debian issues are done so that a package can be
    submitted (man pages, copyright notices, we should talk to Simon
    again though.  I submitted bug 669826 to track this).
  - Make sure the new FAQ page is very detailed about problems relating
    to incorrect tuner (bug 646494).
  - Make sure EWMH support is enabled (bug 646494).
  - Disable the VBI/closed caption code, it's not ready yet (no bug).
  - Write documentation on the low cpu deinterlacing methods (no bug).

3. Postpone until the future
  - We're going to wait on autoscan (bug 633024).
  - We're going to have to wait on some of the smaller UI issues and
    missing options:
      - bug 633235 on 'no on-frame indication of dropped frames'
      - bug 635005 on 'no way to specify deinterlacing algorithm'
      - bug 664637 on 'tvtime should install its own default config'
      - bug 650218 on 'no way to disable deinterlacing algorithms'
      - bug 650218 on 'no support for 16:9 geometry'
      - bug 628943 on 'font aspect not updated with output'
  - I'm not going to finish 3:2 pulldown support for the next release
    (bug 633606).
  - I'm not going to enable the DScaler dll loader, there are some
    annoying issues to solve (no bug).
  - We need to make sure our gentoo ebuild is more explicit with the
    required compiler options to avoid problems (no bug).

4. Outstanding issues
  - We badly need to get a usable menu, and the issue is mostly just
    fighting with making sure whatever we choose is simple to extend,
    maintain, and most importantly, simple to use.  Run-time
    configuration with a menu is essential to solving many of our
    current problems with frequency tables, auto-detection, and
    usability.
  - We still need to decide how closely our deinterlacing API should try
    and follow DScaler's, and at what point it will be necessary to add
    4:2:0 support to the API.
