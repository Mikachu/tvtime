626927 Slow compositing routines
 * The compositing routines are slow and cause framedrops on slower
   machines.  We need to do MMX versions.

628943 Font aspect not updated with output
 * If you start tvtime in 16:9 or 4:3 mode and switch using the 'a'
   key, then the OSD fonts aren't updated for the new aspect ratio.

630236 No MMX versions of MMXEXT functions
 * While it would be easy to provide MMX versions of the DScaler-ported
   deinterlacing algorithms, we currently only have MMXEXT versions.
   Shouldn't take long just haven't bothered yet.

632781 Data bars mess up at other frame sizes 
 * If you're not using 720 pixels/scanline input sampling, tvtime
   doesn't do the volume/data OSD bars correctly.  We have no idea why
   this is yet.

633235 No on-frame indication of dropped frames
 * You can use the -s switch to see when you drop frames, but it would
   be nice to be told somehow using the OSD or something...

636423 No support for 16:9 geometry output
 * We should detect when your monitor's aspect ratio is not 4:3 and
   correct for that, and also check for non-square pixel sizes.

636424 Xinerama support
 * We should enable the Xinerama support code from ogle that we have
   in our source tree.


Known incompatibility problems
------------------------------

630585 blits are still taking waaay too long
 * We've had alot of reports about Geforce2 users having really poor
   blit performance.  See the bug report for more details.  We
   suspect this may have to do with slow AGP on some crappy
   motherboards.

636338 XVideo extremely slow on sis
 * The SiS drivers currently in X have really slow XVideo (it polls
   waiting for the retrace every upload).  Apparently these drivers
   will be put in X soon and have much better performance:

628292 Voodoo 3500 TV card.
 * This card has minimal V4L support but no support for capturing
   it seems, which is required for tvtime.

630198 preemptive kernel from gentoo
 * The preemptive kernel patches backport to 2.4.19 in gentoo apparently
   break the bttv driver.  I'd like this to be confirmed elsewhere.

634674 tvtime drops frames when gkrellm running
 * On one user's system, gkrellm was polling an ntfs partition.  There
   may be some kernel driver that is blocking for a really long time,
   and screwing up our captures.


General Info for improving video quality
----------------------------------------

If you are having problems with video strangeness, try disabling Macrovision 
in your bttv driver (if you have a bttv card). See 
http://www.colby.edu/personal/k/kjseptor/bttv.html for info on that.

If you are experiencing a generally fuzzy picture, try moving your tv card 
one or two slots away from your soundcard (inside your pc). Interference from 
the soundcard can mess up some channels.
