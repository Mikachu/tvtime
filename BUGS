  Known bugs
  ----------

727990 kscreensaver shutdown too slow
  * We have disabled our code to shut down kscreensaver when running
    tvtime, as it makes tvtime's startup way too slow in many
    situations.
726635 Don't create a new entry if freq already exists
  * If you accidentally hit F9, even when turned to a valid channel, it
    will create a new custom frequency entry anyway.
727947 tvtime needs a -geometry environment variable
727946 tvtime needs a -display command line flag.
726637 Duplicate frequencies should automatically be disabled
  * The europe channel list has many duplicate frequencies (same
    channel, different name).  We should start with disabling them.
726822 Filter not hitting all scanlines when using dalias' pulldown
694544 linux-dvb driver broken and CVS version needs V4L2 support
725830 BadAtom errors from something
723926 icons should be installed by the source distribution
717289 OSD fadeout time should depend on TV norm
720075 client / server mode
720072 Closed Caption text messed up
721200 Numeral feedback for V4L settings
721203 Single-press should display settings
722855 SRPM dependency on glibc-debug
715054 screenshot too slow
711336 [Debian] Don't ship with fonts
711330 Debconfiscate /etc/tvtime/tvtimerc
709500 Text shadow not sub-pixel position correct
691857 tvtime ignores wss signals
628943 Font aspect not updated with output
 * If you start tvtime in 16:9 or 4:3 mode and switch using the 'a'
   key, then the OSD fonts aren't updated for the new aspect ratio.
692392 XVideo problems with two X servers and X4.2.1 mga driver
634674 tvtime drops frames when gkrellm running
 * On one user's system, gkrellm was polling an ntfs partition.  There
   may be some kernel driver that is blocking for a really long time,
   and screwing up our captures.
694681 No way to change deinterlacer settings
650218 No way to disable deinterlacing algs
690473 Blue frame shown on channel change when gbuffers=2
696107 rtc error should indicate if permissions wrong
696517 Scanner poorly documented
707738 No way to disable signal detection at runtime
704780 greedy2frame and twoframe ports busted
698201 XVideo output failed to initialize
720432 Bring back the tvtime logo
725194 tvtime show gently poke xscreensaver instead of killing it.
720300 ontop feature
630236 No MMX versions of MMXEXT functions
 * While it would be easy to provide MMX versions of the DScaler-ported
   deinterlacing algorithms, we currently only have MMXEXT versions.
   Shouldn't take long just haven't bothered yet.
633235 No on-frame indication of dropped frames
 * You can use the -s switch to see when you drop frames, but it would
   be nice to be told somehow using the OSD or something...
691797 rivatv requires UYVY support
725864 videobob port is broken
724354 tvtime should not clobber settings as aggressively
705179 tvtime help.html page not 4.01 strict


  Fullscreen bugs
  ---------------

  There have been some updates to our fullscreen code, however, we still
very much fear some of these fullscreen issues.  Please, if you can test
or provide fixes for your window manager, it would be very much
appreciated.  Some problems are known but not reproducable or not well
understood by the authors.
