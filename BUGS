 * If you start tvtime in 16:9 or 4:3 mode and switch using the 'a'
   key, then the OSD fonts aren't updated for the new aspect ratio.
692392 XVideo problems with two X servers and X4.2.1 mga driver
634674 tvtime drops frames when gkrellm running
 * On one user's system, gkrellm was polling an ntfs partition.  There
   may be some kernel driver that is blocking for a really long time,
   and screwing up our captures.
694681 No way to change deinterlacer settings
650218 No way to disable deinterlacing algs
690473 Blue frame shown on channel change when gbuffers=2

630236 No MMX versions of MMXEXT functions
 * While it would be easy to provide MMX versions of the DScaler-ported
   deinterlacing algorithms, we currently only have MMXEXT versions.
   Shouldn't take long just haven't bothered yet.
633235 No on-frame indication of dropped frames
 * You can use the -s switch to see when you drop frames, but it would
   be nice to be told somehow using the OSD or something...
691797 rivatv requires UYVY support
725864 videobob port is broken
724354 tvtime should not clobber settings as aggressively
705179 tvtime help.html page not 4.01 strict


Fullscreen bugs
---------------
There have been some updates to our fullscreen code, however,
we still very much fear some of these fullscreen issues.  Please,
if you can test or provide fixes for your window manager, it would
be very much appreciated.  Some problems are known but not
reproducable by the authors.

General Info for improving video quality
----------------------------------------

If you are having problems with video strangeness, try disabling Macrovision 
in your bttv driver (if you have a bttv card). See 
http://www.colby.edu/personal/k/kjseptor/bttv.html for info on that.

If you are experiencing a generally fuzzy picture, try moving your tv card 
one or two slots away from your soundcard (inside your pc). Interference from 
the soundcard can mess up some channels.
