Code we stole (well, used under the GPL)

  Lots of stuff from DScaler
    http://dscaler.sourceforge.net/
    We currently use their code for the twoframe and greedy2frame
    deinterlacing algorithms, more to follow.
    DScaler is a constant reference for optimization ideas, features
    we could add, and program structure.
    Being a reasonable 'port' of much of the DScaler code is definitely
    one of our goals.

  Freetype2 code and compositing ideas from mythtv
    http://mythtv.sourceforge.net/
    The ttfont.[h,c] is from mythtv, original code from Carsten Haitzler,
    citing Copyright (C) 1999 Carsten Haitzler and various contributors.
    Hopefully this will be cleaned up/merged to be common with mythtv.

  Some great colourbar generation and Y'CbCr<->R'G'B' code
    Copyright (C) 2001 Matthew J. Marjanovic <maddog@mir.com>
    Taken from lavtools under the mjpegtools project:

  mmx.h and friends from libmpeg2
    http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net/
    I think walken is the current maintainer of this gorgeous set of
    #defines for doing MMX programming cleanly under gcc.  I am
    constantly in awe at how great these are to use.

  fastmemcpy stolen from xine
    http://xine.sourceforge.net/
    They got it apparently from mplayer.  I took their version because
    I happened to have it around.  I have not done my own performance
    tests yet.

  Mixer routines stolen from mplayer
    http://mplayer.sourceforge.net/
    I took these a while back while doing movietime.
