Code we stole (well, used under the GPL/LGPL)

  Lots of stuff from DScaler
    http://dscaler.sourceforge.net/
    We currently use their code for the twoframe and greedy2frame
    deinterlacing algorithms, more to follow.
    DScaler is a constant reference for optimization ideas, features
    we could add, and program structure.
    Being a reasonable 'port' of much of the DScaler code is definitely
    one of our goals.

  Original Freetype2 code, compositing ideas, and XMLTV code from MythTV
    http://mythtv.sourceforge.net/
    We since rewrote our font renderer, but originally we borrowed from
    this great project.  It would be nice to re-sync some of our rendering
    code.  We also took ideas on how to parse some of the XMLTV stuff from
    the MythTV codebase.

  Some great colourbar generation and Y'CbCr<->R'G'B' code
    Copyright (C) 2001 Matthew J. Marjanovic <maddog@mir.com>
    Taken from lavtools under the mjpegtools project:
    http://mjpegtools.sourceforge.net/

  mmx.h and friends, and some X-related configure macros, from libmpeg2
    http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net/
    walken rewrote mmx.h based on the originals (c) 1999-2002 R. Fisher.
    The style is awesome and they're really great to use.
    I also got some help with my Xv code from walken's xv module in
    libmpeg2.

  Some Xv output code help, XTest code, and fastmemcpy stolen from xine
    http://xine.sourceforge.net/
    They apparently got the fastmemcpy from mplayer.  I took their version
    because I happened to have it around.  I have not done my own performance
    tests yet.

  Mixer routines stolen from mplayer
    I took these a while back while doing movietime.
    http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

  Contains fonts which are hosted under the freefont project:
    http://www.nongnu.org/freefont/

  Lots of help with the V4L API, bttv-specific features, and tuner dealings
  from the source of video4linux information, xawtv, by Gerd Knorr:
    http://bytesex.org/xawtv/

  Univeral tuner frequency tables from Nathan Laredo's tvset
    http://linuxtv.openprojects.net/

  Postscript credit renderer by Nathan Laredo <laredo@gnu.org>
    http://postscriptcode.com/

  Xv code, and other X code in general, taken from tvset and playdvd,
  both by Nathan Laredo.

  X fullscreen code and some other X/Xinerama/XF86VidMode code from ogle,
  a video player:
    http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~dvd/
    Bjorn is the X master, lots of help from him, and thanks to hh for
    being so cool.
    The code is Copyright (C) 2001, 2002 Björn Englund, Håkan Hjort.

  Code and ideas on 2-3 pulldown detection by
    D Richard Felker III <dalias@aerifal.cx>, from his work on
    deinterlacer filters for mplayer
    http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

  MMX code for the MPEG2-style vertical [-1 4 2 4 -1]/8 deinterlacer
  filter from ffmpeg by Fabrice Bellard:
    http://ffmpeg.org/
