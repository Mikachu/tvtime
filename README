tvtime is a high quality television application for use with video
capture cards.  tvtime processes the input from a capture card and
displays it on a computer monitor or projector.  Unlike other television
applications, tvtime focuses on high visual quality making it ideal for
videophiles.

  tvtime supports:

  o   Deinterlaced output at full interlaced rate of 59.94 frames per
      second for NTSC source, or 50 frames per second for PAL sources.
      This gives smoothness of motion and high visual quality.

  o   Multiple deinterlacing algorithms for finding the optimal mode for
      your video content and available processor speed.

  o   16:9 aspect ratio mode for the highest available resolution when
      processing input from an external DVD player or digital satellite
      receiver.

  o   A super-slick on-screen-display for the complete television
      experience.

  o   2-3 Pulldown detection for optimal quality viewing of film content
      from NTSC sources.

1 Where to find help with tvtime
  ------------------------------

Detailed help, documentation, known bugs, and known hardware issues 
can be found on the tvtime website:

     http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/


2 How to configure your tvtime
  ----------------------------

Run 'tvtime -h' to get a list of command line arguments.  You can also
save command line arguments to your config file using the -S option.

     tvtime -S -n pal -f europe

  Will save to your config file the norm PAL and frequency table Europe
as your defaults.  See docs/default.tvtime.xml for a default
configuration file and the default runtime keybindings.

  Channel setup keys
    See below


  Commands can be sent to a running tvtime using the 'tvtime-command'
application.  For example, 'tvtime-command channel_up' to change
channel, or 'tvtime-command channel_1 channel_5 enter' to change to
channel 15.  Run 'tvtime-command' to get a list of commands.


4 Setting up your channel list in tvtime
  --------------------------------------

tvtime supports a channel scanner, channel renumbering, channel names,
and a list of active channels for browsing.  Below are the commands
available for input bindings and through tvtime-command, along with
their default key bindings.

  Command reference:

  CHANNEL_SAVE_TUNING (F9)
    - Saves the current fine tuning settings as a custom channel in the
      station list.

  CHANNEL_SCAN (F10)
    - Walks from the current position through the channel list,
      disabling any channels for which no signal is detected.  This
      command is only available if signal checking is enabled.

  CHANNEL_ACTIVATE_ALL (F11)
    - Re-activates all channels in the list.  Use this to re-initialize
      the channel list before running the scanner if you believe some
      channels are missing, or if new channels have become available.

  CHANNEL_SKIP (F12)
    - Toggles the current channel as being active or disabled in the
      station list.  You can use this to manually scan your channels and
      enable those with signal or disable duplicate stations.

  CHANNEL_RENUMBER (r)
    - Renumbers the current channel.  This will swap the current channel
      with the number you type in.  Use this to configure your station
      list to suit preference or locality.


4.1 stationlist.xml
    ---------------

The station listing is read in from the ~/.tvtime/stationlist.xml.
Channel settings are saved specific to norm and frequency table.
Entries in a list are in the following form:

       <station name="CNN" active="1" position="18"
                band="US Cable" channel="18"/>
       <station name="DSF" active="1" position="12"
                band="VHF E2-E12" channel="E12"/>

  The possible bands and frequencies available in tvtime are:

    Band name           Stations provided
    ---------           -----------------
    US Cable            1 - 125
    US Two-Way          T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12 T13, T14
    US Broadcast        2 - 83
    Japan Broadcast     1 - 62
    Japan Cable         13 - 63
    VHF E2-E12          E1 - E12
    VHF S1-S41          S1 - S41
    VHF Misc            X, Y, Z, Z+1, Z+2
    VHF France          K01 - K10, KB - KQ, H01 - H19
    VHF Russia          R1 - R12, SR1 - SR19
    VHF Australia       AS1 - AS12, AS5A, AS9A
    VHF Italy           A - H, H1, H2
    VHF Ireland         I1 - I9
    UHF                 U21 - U69
    Australia Optus     01 - 058

  Custom frequencies can be included manually as follows:

       <station name="2" active="1" position="0"
                band="Custom" channel="55.69MHz"/>


4.2 Future enhancements
    -------------------

tvtime still needs a method of editing channel names at runtime
(should not be hard), a full frequency band scanner, native support for
the weird frequencies used by some cable providers such as UPC.
