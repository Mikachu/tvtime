  tvtime is a high quality television application for use with video capture
cards.  tvtime processes the input from a capture card and displays it on a
computer monitor or projector.

  tvtime supports:

  o   Deinterlaced output at full interlaced rate of 59.94 frames per
      second for NTSC source, or 50 frames per second for PAL sources.
      This gives smoothness of motion and high visual quality.

  o   Multiple deinterlacing algorithms for finding the optimal mode for
      your video content and available processor speed.

  o   16:9 aspect ratio mode for the highest available resolution when
      processing input from an external DVD player or digital satellite
      receiver.

  o   A super-slick on-screen-display for the complete television
      experience.

  o   2-3 Pulldown detection for optimal quality viewing of film content
      from NTSC sources.


  See docs/default.tvtime.xml for a default configuration file and the
default runtime keybindings.

  Run 'tvtime -h' to get a list of command line arguments.

  More detailed help, documentation, and known hardware issues can be
