  tvtime is a high quality television application for use with video capture
cards.  tvtime processes the input from a capture card and displays it on a
computer monitor or projector.

  tvtime supports:

  o   Deinterlaced output at full interlaced rate of 59.94 frames per
      second for NTSC source, or 50 frames per second for PAL sources.
      This gives smoothness of motion and high visual quality.

  o   Multiple deinterlacing algorithms for finding the optimal mode for
      the video content and available processor speed.

  o   16:9 aspect ratio mode for the highest available resolution when
      processing input from an external DVD player or digital satellite
      receiver.

  o   A super-slick on-screen-display for the complete television
      experience.
