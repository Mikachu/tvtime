News for 0.9.8

  *  New XML config file format for both the tvtime configuration,
     and the station list.
  *  tvtime now has two distinct half-framerate modes: top-field-first
     frames, and bottom-field-first frames.  This helps with manually
     deinterlacing 2-2 pulldown or progressive content.
  *  Added support for preset 'modes', which can set the deinterlacer,
     window size, fullscreen setting and framerate mode.
  *  Added support for custom frequencies in the stationlist.xml file,
     and a runtime command to add a new station from the current
     fine-tuning settings.
  *  Added the ffmpeg vertical deinterlacer filter.
  *  Added some DScaler DLLs and a wine layer to load these deinterlacer
     plugins directly without porting to Linux.  This gives us the
     following new deinterlacers:
       GreedyH        DScaler: Greedy - High Motion
       Greedy2Frame   DScaler: Greedy - 2-frame
       TwoFrame       DScaler: TwoFrame
       TomsMoComp     DScaler: TomsMoComp
       VideoBob       DScaler: Video Bob
       VideoWeave     DScaler: Video Weave
     We had our own ports of videobob, twoframe, and greedy2frame,
     but they were found to be buggy.  Our ports are currently disabled.
  *  Support for multiple audio channels (stereo, mono, lang1, lang2).
  *  Included a bunch of fixes for PAL-M support.
  *  Various speedups, quality improvements, and bugfixes.

News for 0.9.7

  *  Moved config files into a new config file directory ~/.tvtime
  *  Reworked the frequency tables, merging europe-cable, europe-west,
     europe-east all into 'europe'.  Added the 'russia' frequency table.
  *  Added a channel scanner.  F10 walks through the channel list and
     disables inactive channels.
  *  Added the 'XVideo Bob' deinterlacer filter.
  *  Added lirc support.
  *  Added the overscan feature.
  *  Added hardware support webpage.
  *  Added a half-framerate mode ('=' to activate it).
  *  Fixed alot of bug reports.

News for 0.9.6

  *  We updated the tuner frequencies, please make sure you're up to
     date with our naming.
  *  We added alot of keymaps, so we also changed some of the default
     keys!
  *  tvtime now shows a blue screen if the tuner reports no signal.
     Please let me know if this exposes any problems.
