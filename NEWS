News for 0.9.8

  Users of tvtime 0.9.7:
    The default key bindings and configuration file format have
    significantly changed in this release of tvtime.  Please see the
    documentation for details on using tvtime 0.9.8.

    Also, some command line options have changed or become unavailable
    (no more -w, use -H instead).  Please consult the tvtime man page.

  *  New XML config file format for both the tvtime configuration,
     and the station list.
  *  tvtime now has two distinct half-framerate modes: top-field-first
     frames, and bottom-field-first frames.  This helps with manually
     deinterlacing 2-2 pulldown or progressive content.
  *  Added support for preset 'modes', which can set the deinterlacer,
     window size, fullscreen setting and framerate mode.
  *  Added support for custom frequencies in the stationlist.xml file,
     and a runtime command to add a new station from the current
     fine-tuning settings.
  *  Added some DScaler DLLs and a wine layer to load these deinterlacer
     plugins directly without porting to Linux.  This gives us the
     following new deinterlacers:
       GreedyH        DScaler: Greedy - High Motion
       Greedy2Frame   DScaler: Greedy - 2-frame
       TwoFrame       DScaler: TwoFrame
       TomsMoComp     DScaler: TomsMoComp
       VideoBob       DScaler: Video Bob
       VideoWeave     DScaler: Video Weave
     We had our own ports of videobob, twoframe, and greedy2frame,
     but they were found to be buggy.  Our ports are currently disabled.
  *  Added the ffmpeg vertical deinterlacer filter.
  *  Support for multiple audio channels (stereo, mono, lang1, lang2).
  *  Included a bunch of fixes for PAL-M support.
  *  Added a slave mode for freevo integration.
  *  Various speedups, quality improvements, and bugfixes.

News for 0.9.7

  *  Moved config files into a new config file directory ~/.tvtime
  *  Reworked the frequency tables, merging europe-cable, europe-west,
     europe-east all into 'europe'.  Added the 'russia' frequency table.
  *  Added a channel scanner.  F10 walks through the channel list and
     disables inactive channels.
  *  Added the 'XVideo Bob' deinterlacer filter.
  *  Added lirc support.
  *  Added the overscan feature.
  *  Added hardware support webpage.
  *  Added a half-framerate mode ('=' to activate it).
  *  Fixed alot of bug reports.

News for 0.9.6

  *  We updated the tuner frequencies, please make sure you're up to
     date with our naming.
  *  We added alot of keymaps, so we also changed some of the default
     keys!
  *  tvtime now shows a blue screen if the tuner reports no signal.
     Please let me know if this exposes any problems.
