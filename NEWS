News for 0.9.6

  *  We updated the tuner frequencies, please make sure you're up to
     date with our naming.
  *  We added alot of keymaps, so we also changed some of the default
     keys!
  *  tvtime now shows a blue screen if the tuner reports no signal.
     Please let me know if this exposes any problems.
