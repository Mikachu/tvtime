0.9.6
  * (vektor) We now use XF86VidModeExtension, if available, to choose our
    fullscreen mode (bug 628290)
  * (bitstream) Added support for muting of the TV card instead of muting
    the master mixer volume: MuteTVCard option in the tvtimerc (bug 633222)
  * (rascasse) Added a man page for the tvtimerc file to the docs directory
    (still not installed, part of bug 633042)
  * (rascasse) Added an RPM spec file to the docs directory
  * (vektor) Added a hack/fix for a resize loop that was occuring.  If
    you resized the window it would start wildly resizing itself for a
    while.  Seems to not happen anymore here.
  * (vektor) Added support for fine tuning of channels (bug 630598)
  * (vektor) Improved the warning messages for tuners that are silly, this
    makes the warnings less offensive for saa7134 users (bug 633039)
  * (bitstream) OSD clock updates while on screen (bug 628186)
  * (diz) Postscript code for credits listing
  * (vektor) Added credits listing, updated the credits
  * (bitstream) Support for multiple key bindings (bug 633043)
  * (vektor) Tuner code does not search for a channel with an active
    frequency anymore, solving some hangs on systems where channels are
    sparse (bug 629275)
  * (bitstream) Whitespace ignored at end of config file options (bug 633048)
  * (vektor) Spelling updates in the defaults.tvtimerc file (bug 634068)
  * (bitstream) Mouse button support in the config file, wheel buttons default
    to channel up/down

  * (vektor) Cleanup of the /dev/rtc handling, can still use /dev/rtc even if
    we can't get high resolution timing from it
  * (vektor) Smoothness improvement, frames are now scheduled at
    more correct times.  Added a performance tracker object
  * (vektor) Removed the force-DScaler-defaults on startup for V4L settings
  * (vektor) Improved OSD display to show more information more consistently
  * (vektor) Added a poor configure check for freetype2, this should
    be improved in the future
