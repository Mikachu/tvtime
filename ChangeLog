  * vektor: Removed the scanline bias feature until I determine if it's
      actually a good idea
  * vektor: We no longer grab mouse and keyboard on fullscreen, as this
      has problems with ewmh (no alt-tab away from a fullscreen app) and also
      with multi-head displays.  We still need to decide what to do when the
      virtual res is smaller than the display (fixes bug 691707)

  * vektor: Added commands for scanline length bias and overscan
  * vektor: Added a channel scanner that rocks sooo much
  * vektor: We now set the window and palette with V4L before using mmap
      mode.  This should solve some issues with V4L drivers other than bttv
  * vektor: Fixed a bunch of OSD crap relating to inputs with no tuner, and
      some unnecessary error messages will be avoided
  * batchall: Added a more flexible station subsystem. Deactivated channels
      are saved now, more to come
  * vektor: Moved fonts and graphics into the data directory
  * vektor: Increased the version number of the deinterlace plugin API
  * vektor: Removed the mlockall() call, I don't want to bother with
      that right now

      plugin (feature request 642661)

  * vektor: Fixed the input frame height for PAL-M, should be 480 not 576
      (fixes bug 646494)
  * rascasse: You can now specify the startup deinterlacing alg (fixes 635005)
  * vektor: You can now change the default process priority in the .tvtimerc
      using the ProcessPriority value

  * vektor: We now drop root priviledges if tvtime is setuid root and run
      as a normal user (bug 630210)
  * vektor: Redid a bunch of the default key bindings.
  * vektor: Added our own XVideo output module, using fullscreen and VidMode
      code from Ogle.  This may give better performance.
  * vektor: Removed SDL and DirectFB output drivers from the distribution
      for now.
  * vektor: We now use XF86VidModeExtension, if available, to choose our
      fullscreen mode (bug 628290)
  * bitstream: Added support for muting of the TV card instead of muting
      the master mixer volume: MuteTVCard option in the tvtimerc (bug 633222)
  * rascasse: Added a man page for the tvtimerc file to the docs directory
      (still not installed or in the dist, part of bug 633042)
  * rascasse: Added an RPM spec file to the docs directory
  * vektor: Added a hack/fix for a resize loop that was occuring.  If
      you resized the window it would start wildly resizing itself for a
      while.  Seems to not happen anymore here.
  * vektor: Added support for fine tuning of channels (bug 630598)
  * vektor: Improved the warning messages for tuners that are silly, this
      makes the warnings less offensive for saa7134 users (bug 633039)
  * bitstream: OSD clock updates while on screen (bug 628186)
  * diz: Postscript code for credits listing
  * vektor: Added credits listing, updated the credits
  * bitstream: Support for multiple key bindings (bug 633043)
  * vektor: Tuner code does not search for a channel with an active
      frequency anymore, solving some hangs on systems where channels are
      sparse (bug 629275)
  * bitstream: Whitespace ignored at end of config file options (bug 633048)
  * vektor: Spelling updates in the defaults.tvtimerc file (bug 634068)
  * bitstream: Mouse button support in the config file, wheel buttons default
      to channel up/down

0.9.5 - Sat Nov  2 19:55:45 AST 2002
  * vektor: Cleanup of the /dev/rtc handling, can still use /dev/rtc even if
      we can't get high resolution timing from it
  * vektor: Smoothness improvement, frames are now scheduled at
      more correct times.  Added a performance tracker object
  * vektor: Removed the force-DScaler-defaults on startup for V4L settings
  * vektor: Improved OSD display to show more information more consistently
  * vektor: Added a poor configure check for freetype2, this should
      be improved in the future
