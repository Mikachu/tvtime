  * (vektor) Cleanup of the /dev/rtc handling, can still use /dev/rtc even if
    we can't get high resolution timing from it.
  * (vektor) Smoothness improvement, frames are now scheduled at
    more correct times.  Added a performance tracker object.
  * (vektor) Removed the force-DScaler-defaults on startup for V4L settings.
  * (vektor) Improved OSD display to show more information more consistently.
  * (vektor) Added a poor configure check for freetype2, this should
    be improved in the future.
