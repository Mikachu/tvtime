0.9.8
  * (vektor) tvtime now doesn't render output when the window is obscured or
    hidden.
  * (vektor) Added console app 'tvtime-command' to send commands to a running
    tvtime instance using the fifo.
  * (vektor) configure.ac now fails if X isn't found.
  * (vektor) Enabled DScaler DLL filters, added the wine directory.
  * (vektor) Completely removed the scanline bias code, I don't think it's
    the right hting to do.
  * (vektor) We now depend on libxml2 in our configure script.
  * (vektor) Enabled the console code.
  * (batchall) Stations are now saved in ~/.tvime/stationrc. Happy editing.
  * (vektor) Added Seli's kwin fix for ogle's fullscreen code.

0.9.7 - Wed Feb 26 21:58:13 AST 2003
  * (vektor) Added a temporary and nasty hack to avoid fullscreen problems
    with KWin from KDE 3.1 (avoids bug 692137)
  * (vektor) tvtime now creates the ~/.tvtime/tvtimerc file on startup
  * (vektor) tvtime now creates the ~/.tvtime directory on startup
  * (vektor) Fixed screenshot code to handle the XVideo Bob filter
  * (vektor) Added back "newzealand" at least for 0.9.7 (fixes bug 690983)
  * (vektor) Removed the scanline bias feature until I determine if it's
    actually a good idea
  * (vektor) We no longer grab mouse and keyboard on fullscreen, as this
    has problems with ewmh (no alt-tab away from a fullscreen app) and also
    with multi-head displays.  We still need to decide what to do when the
    virtual res is smaller than the display (fixes bug 691707)
  * (vektor) We now show the cursor on motion, hide it on inactivity.
  * (vektor) Limit to 4 buffers from the card, even if they provide more.
    This fixes a/v sync issues (fixes bug 691629)
  * (vektor) Europe-east is now just part of the 'europe' frequency map.
    If you are just using the OIRT frequencies and UHF, you can also use
    'russia' (fixes 640620)
  * (vektor) More confident about the australian channel map (fixes 650055)
  * (PunkeR) Added numeric channel commands for better lirc support
  * (vektor) Added commands for scanline length bias and overscan
  * (vektor) Added a channel scanner that rocks sooo much
  * (vektor) We now set the window and palette with V4L before using mmap
    mode.  This should solve some issues with V4L drivers other than bttv
  * (vektor) Fixed a bunch of OSD crap relating to inputs with no tuner, and
    some unnecessary error messages will be avoided
  * (batchall) Added a more flexible station subsystem. Deactivated channels
    are saved now, more to come
  * (vektor) Moved fonts and graphics into the data directory
  * (vektor) Increased the version number of the deinterlace plugin API
  * (vektor) Removed the mlockall() call, I don't want to bother with
    that right now
  * (vektor) Added the 'XVideo Bob' equivalent to DScaler's 'scalerbob'
    plugin (feature request 642661)
  * (vektor) Added the SECAM-DK frequencies ("russia")
  * (vektor) Officially re-enabled the EWMH code from the ogle
    fullscreen handler wm_state.c
  * (vektor) Reverted to previous frequencies.h format
  * (vektor) Added a half-framerate mode, default key is '='
  * (xlnx-x) Added a previous channel button
  * (vektor) We now exit properly on window manager destroy messages
    (fixes 659877)
  * (vektor) Added a configure check for Xinerama (bug 636424)
  * (vektor) Fixed the input frame height for PAL-M, should be 480 not 576
    (fixes bug 646494)
  * (rascasse) You can now specify the startup deinterlacing alg (fixes 635005)
  * (vektor) You can now change the default process priority in the .tvtimerc
    using the ProcessPriority value

0.9.6 - Thu Nov 14 16:37:25 AST 2002
  * (bitstream) Added the -m switch to start fullscreen (bug 636044)
  * (bitstream) Added configurable OSD colours to the tvtimerc.
  * (vektor) We now drop root priviledges if tvtime is setuid root and run
    as a normal user (bug 630210)
  * (vektor) Redid a bunch of the default key bindings.
  * (vektor) Added our own XVideo output module, using fullscreen and VidMode
    code from Ogle.  This may give better performance.
  * (vektor) Removed SDL and DirectFB output drivers from the distribution
    for now.
  * (vektor) We now use XF86VidModeExtension, if available, to choose our
    fullscreen mode (bug 628290)
  * (bitstream) Added support for muting of the TV card instead of muting
    the master mixer volume: MuteTVCard option in the tvtimerc (bug 633222)
  * (rascasse) Added a man page for the tvtimerc file to the docs directory
    (still not installed or in the dist, part of bug 633042)
  * (rascasse) Added an RPM spec file to the docs directory
  * (vektor) Added a hack/fix for a resize loop that was occuring.  If
    you resized the window it would start wildly resizing itself for a
    while.  Seems to not happen anymore here.
  * (vektor) Added support for fine tuning of channels (bug 630598)
  * (vektor) Improved the warning messages for tuners that are silly, this
    makes the warnings less offensive for saa7134 users (bug 633039)
  * (bitstream) OSD clock updates while on screen (bug 628186)
  * (diz) Postscript code for credits listing
  * (vektor) Added credits listing, updated the credits
  * (bitstream) Support for multiple key bindings (bug 633043)
  * (vektor) Tuner code does not search for a channel with an active
    frequency anymore, solving some hangs on systems where channels are
    sparse (bug 629275)
  * (bitstream) Whitespace ignored at end of config file options (bug 633048)
  * (vektor) Spelling updates in the defaults.tvtimerc file (bug 634068)
  * (bitstream) Mouse button support in the config file, wheel buttons default
    to channel up/down

0.9.5 - Sat Nov  2 19:55:45 AST 2002
  * (vektor) Cleanup of the /dev/rtc handling, can still use /dev/rtc even if
    we can't get high resolution timing from it
  * (vektor) Smoothness improvement, frames are now scheduled at
    more correct times.  Added a performance tracker object
  * (vektor) Removed the force-DScaler-defaults on startup for V4L settings
  * (vektor) Improved OSD display to show more information more consistently
  * (vektor) Added a poor configure check for freetype2, this should
    be improved in the future
